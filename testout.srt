The man in black will soon be here

4
1:2:3,150 --> 1:2:7,737
With his cleaver's blade so true

5
1:2:8,322 --> 1:2:12,33
He'll make mincemeat out of you!

6
1:2:12,285 --> 1:2:13,743
You're out.

7
1:2:34,974 --> 1:2:38,393
I told you to stop singing
that awful song!

8
1:2:39,312 --> 1:2:41,146
Didn't you hear me?

9
1:2:44,567 --> 1:2:46,776
That same cursed song over and over!

10
1:3:9,550 --> 1:3:13,386
Dear me, that's heavy.

11
1:3:34,367 --> 1:3:35,825
What's the matter?

12
1:3:36,744 --> 1:3:39,954
I told those kids to stop
singing that awful song,

13
1:3:40,206 --> 1:3:42,582
but they sing it all day long.

14
1:3:42,833 --> 1:3:45,85
As if we haven't heard
enough of that murderer already.

15
1:3:45,252 --> 1:3:46,836
Ah, leave 'em alone.

16
1:3:47,88 --> 1:3:49,297
As long as we can hear 'em singing,

17
1:3:49,423 --> 1:3:51,758

they're still there.

"Little Kurt Klawitzky and his sister Klara
have been missing since June 11th.

22

Evidence leads us to believe
the children were victims of a crime

similar to that committed
last fall against the Doering siblings".

24

26
1:5:57,885 --> 1:6:0,94
Elsie Beckmann.

27
1:6:28,332 --> 1:6:30,124
Didn't Elsie come with you?

No, she didn't.

30
1:7:4,451 --> 1:7:6,119
Thank you.

31
1:7:17,464 --> 1:7:20,633
A thrilling new chapter, Mrs. Beckmann.
Passionate and moving.

32
1:7:22,386 --> 1:7:24,387
Just a moment, Mr. Gehrke.

33
1:7:27,141 --> 1:7:28,808
Tell me, Mr. Gehrke.

34
1:7:29,935 --> 1:7:31,853
Have you seen little Elsie?

35
1:7:32,104 --> 1:7:35,106
No. Didn't she just
come up the stairs?

36
1:7:35,482 --> 1:7:38,318
No, she's not home yet.

37
1:7:38,485 --> 1:7:41,195
She won't be long now.
Good-bye.

38
1:7:41,947 --> 1:7:43,990

to this ever present danger

62

it is likely to assume.

63
1:11:22,376 --> 1:11:25,503
A little candy, a toy, or an apple

64
1:11:25,921 --> 1:11:30,49
can suffice to lure a child
to his or her doom".

65
1:11:30,509 --> 1:11:32,385
Very true!

66
1:11:33,762 --> 1:11:35,596
Keep reading.

67
1:11:37,141 --> 1:11:39,934
"Anxiety among the general public

to apprehend a suspect.

69

But the police are faced
with the almost impossible task

70
1:11:50,70 --> 1:11:54,574

not the slightest clue behind.

71
1:11:55,242 --> 1:11:57,76
Who is the murderer?'

72
1:11:57,202 --> 1:11:58,744

1:11:59,872 --> 1:12:1,247
Where is he hiding?

74
1:12:1,456 --> 1:12:4,834
No one knows him,
yet he is among us.

75
1:12:5,85 --> 1:12:8,421
Anybody sitting next to you
could be the murderer".

76
1:12:11,425 --> 1:12:13,926
Yes, that's very true.

77
1:12:14,52 --> 1:12:17,597
- Why look at me when you say that?
- You know very well.

78
1:12:18,515 --> 1:12:20,141
What do I know very well?

79
1:12:21,268 --> 1:12:24,103
Think about it.
It'll come to you.

80
1:12:25,63 --> 1:12:26,939
What are you saying?

81
1:12:27,107 --> 1:12:32,320
I saw you follow that little girl
from the fourth floor up the stairs.

82
1:12:32,487 --> 1:12:34,655
You're crazy, you dirty swine!

83
1:12:34,907 --> 1:12:37,950
Who's the swine?
Me, or a man who chases little girls?

<i>And the police fall for it!</i>

92
1:13:4,811 --> 1:13:5,978
<i>A search warrant!</i>

93
1:13:6,230 --> 1:13:8,606
How awful! What a disgrace!

94
1:13:8,774 --> 1:13:10,942
Searching a man's house
based on an anonymous letter!

95
1:13:11,109 --> 1:13:15,988
Mr. Jäger, please calm down.
We're only doing our job.

96
1:13:16,323 --> 1:13:20,159
As if it weren't enough
that we're in constant fear for our kids!

97
1:13:20,369 --> 1:13:24,497
You see? That's why the police
must follow up every lead.

98
1:13:24,957 --> 1:13:27,708
Any man on the street
could be the murderer.

99
1:13:30,170 --> 1:13:32,338
Can you please tell me
what time it is?

100
1:13:32,506 --> 1:13:34,6
Yes, my child.

101
1:13:40,555 --> 1:13:44,684
Now you must hurry home.
Where do you live?

102
1:13:45,227 --> 1:13:47,728
What's it to you
where the kid lives?

103
1:13:50,357 --> 1:13:51,315
Excuse me?

104
1:13:51,441 --> 1:13:53,192
What do you want with that kid?

105
1:13:54,319 --> 1:13:56,862
Absolutely nothing!

106
1:13:57,72 --> 1:13:59,282
What do you want with me?

107
1:13:59,533 --> 1:14:1,158
I'll show you what I want!

108
1:14:1,368 --> 1:14:4,870
Let me go!
This is an outrage!

109
1:14:5,122 --> 1:14:7,39
- What's going on?
- This is an outrage!

110
1:14:7,249 --> 1:14:9,959
- What does Four-Eyes want?
- Don't get so excited.

111
1:14:10,127 --> 1:14:13,170
First chatting up children...
- Punch him in the face!

112
1:14:13,380 --> 1:14:14,797
then acting like a big shot!

113
1:14:14,923 --> 1:14:18,884
Will you let me go!
I didn't even speak to the child!

114
1:14:19,52 --> 1:14:21,929
- Get her alone, eh?
- And kill her like the others, right?

115
1:14:22,180 --> 1:14:25,182
- He's the murderer!
- Hold him!

116
1:14:25,392 --> 1:14:26,642
Call the police!

117
1:14:26,893 --> 1:14:30,980
- Never around when you need 'em!
- Officer!

118
1:14:33,692 --> 1:14:37,111
Make way, gentlemen.
Let us through.

119
1:14:37,362 --> 1:14:41,907
Sure, you can catch pickpockets!
Why don't you catch the murderer instead!

120
1:14:42,34 --> 1:14:44,201
What? Is he the murderer?

121
1:14:45,954 --> 1:14:47,455
Break it up!
Come on, move along!

122
1:14:47,706 --> 1:14:49,874
- The murderer!
- The monster!

123
1:14:51,209 --> 1:14:52,752
Get him!

124
1:14:54,421 --> 1:14:56,422
Tackle him!

125
1:15:1,470 --> 1:15:3,679
MURDERER WRITES TO THE PRESS

But I'm not done yet!"

131
1:15:22,115 --> 1:15:24,492
This is a terrible scandal!

132
1:15:24,743 --> 1:15:29,372
Imagine the effect such a note
will have on the public, Commissioner!

133
1:15:29,623 --> 1:15:32,792
This is simply irresponsible!

134
1:15:33,877 --> 1:15:37,963
Mr. Secretary, we cannot stop the murderer
from writing to whomever he wishes!

135
1:15:39,49 --> 1:15:43,302
This severely pathological man
probably takes great pleasure

136
1:15:43,470 --> 1:15:46,847
in seeing his crimes
covered in the press.

137
1:15:47,891 --> 1:15:50,601
We immediately got in touch
with the newspaper

138
1:15:50,727 --> 1:15:53,104
and had them send us
the original letter.

139
1:15:53,230 --> 1:15:55,481
The lab's working on it right now.

140
1:15:55,732 --> 1:16:1,237
<i>Of course, you can't get good
fingerprints from a postcard</i>

141
1:16:1,363 --> 1:16:4,73
<i>that's passed
through so many hands.</i>

142
1:16:4,324 --> 1:16:6,867
<i>Nevertheless,
we will leave no stone unturned.</i>

143
1:16:6,993 --> 1:16:10,121
<i>We'll painstakingly compare
the results against our archives</i>

144
1:16:10,247 --> 1:16:15,418
<i>in hopes of finding something
that can be used to solve this case.</i>

145
1:16:15,669 --> 1:16:18,170
<i>Then we'll send the letter
to our graphologist.</i>

146
1:16:19,339 --> 1:16:24,51
"The aforementioned diamond-shaped
and swelling sweeps,

147
1:16:24,761 --> 1:16:30,808

third line from the bottom..."

148
1:16:30,934 --> 1:16:32,893
You got that?
- Yes.

149
1:16:33,228 --> 1:16:39,525
"...attest to the strongly pathological
sexuality of this sex offender.

150
1:16:39,693 --> 1:16:41,26
Period.

151
1:16:42,195 --> 1:16:48,200
The partially disrupted and uneven style
of his other letters

152
1:16:48,702 --> 1:16:51,620
is, in its interpretation,

153
1:16:52,372 --> 1:16:55,207
<i>a form of acting</i>

154
1:16:55,459 --> 1:17:1,881
<i>which may manifest externally
as indolence or even lethargy.</i>

155
1:17:4,217 --> 1:17:6,927
<i>The writing as a whole displays</i>

156
1:17:7,262 --> 1:17:13,58
<i>elusive yet unmistakable signs</i>

157
1:17:13,477 --> 1:17:16,228
<i>of madness".</i>

158
1:17:18,231 --> 1:17:21,233
Yes, of course, Commissioner.

159
1:17:21,485 --> 1:17:25,738
I have no doubt you're doing your job,
and your men as well.

160
1:17:26,198 --> 1:17:28,240
But we need results!

161
1:17:28,492 --> 1:17:30,75
Results!

162
1:17:33,413 --> 1:17:37,458
Mr. Secretary, my men haven't gotten
12 hours' sleep in an entire week!

163
1:17:38,1 --> 1:17:41,795
<i>My riot squads
don't get a moment's peace.</i>

164
1:17:42,5 --> 1:17:47,134
<i>They report for duty almost more fatigued
than when they were dismissed,</i>

165
1:17:47,636 --> 1:17:51,931
<i>because the painstaking nature
of their work wears on the nerves,</i>

166
1:17:52,140 --> 1:17:56,852
<i>and 80% - if not 90% -
of our leads are false.</i>

167
1:17:57,187 --> 1:18:0,272
<i>The homicide squad doesn't even
get time to change clothes.</i>

168
1:18:0,524 --> 1:18:4,777
<i>They're constantly on call,
always tense and alert,</i>

169
1:18:5,111 --> 1:18:7,404
<i>ever ready to spring into action,</i>

170
1:18:7,531 --> 1:18:10,407
<i>to follow even the slightest lead,</i>

171
1:18:10,617 --> 1:18:13,285
<i>as it just might be
the one that solves the case.</i>

172
1:18:13,578 --> 1:18:17,122
<i>Mr. Secretary, just consider
the search of the crime scene.</i>

173
1:18:18,625 --> 1:18:20,751
<i>To give you an example:</i>

174
1:18:20,919 --> 1:18:25,714
<i>In the bushes
just behind a picket fence,</i>

175
1:18:26,174 --> 1:18:32,179
<i>a small, white, crumpled
paper wrapping was found.</i>

176
1:18:33,306 --> 1:18:35,975
<i>It apparently once contained
inexpensive sweets.</i>

177
1:18:36,851 --> 1:18:39,19
<i>In the outermost corner</i>

178
1:18:39,145 --> 1:18:42,147
<i>were found traces of fruit drops</i>

179
1:18:42,399 --> 1:18:45,484
<i>and particles of powdered sugar.</i>

180
1:18:46,611 --> 1:18:48,821
<i>We've tried to trace the origin
of this wrapper</i>

181
1:18:48,947 --> 1:18:54,451
<i>in every candy shop and grocery store
within a radius of a mile and a half,</i>

182
1:18:55,287 --> 1:18:56,954
<i>but all to no avail.</i>

183
1:18:58,81 --> 1:19:1,166
<i>With each passing day
we expand the area searched.</i>

184
1:19:4,504 --> 1:19:8,424
<i>But, of course,
after such a long time,</i>

185
1:19:8,550 --> 1:19:12,678
<i>no one remembers anything
that could serve as a lead.</i>

186
1:19:13,847 --> 1:19:17,16
<i>Despite all these setbacks,</i>

187
1:19:17,350 --> 1:19:21,729
<i>we're forced to press on
in our investigation,</i>

188
1:19:21,855 --> 1:19:23,480
<i>always in uncertainty,</i>

189
1:19:23,607 --> 1:19:26,692
<i>and with little chance of success</i>

190
1:19:26,901 --> 1:19:30,779
<i>in bringing the case
even one step closer to its conclusion.</i>

191
1:19:30,905 --> 1:19:32,197
<i>Our men are doing everyth...</i>

192
1:19:32,365 --> 1:19:34,742
What good is all this?

193
1:19:34,993 --> 1:19:38,78
Commissioner,
I'm aware you're not dawdling,

194
1:19:38,204 --> 1:19:42,82
but that doesn't change the fact
that an unknown killer

195
1:19:42,334 --> 1:19:46,45
is terrorizing 4 1/2 million people!

196
1:19:46,171 --> 1:19:48,130
And the police are getting nowhere!

197
1:19:50,467 --> 1:19:53,761
Mr. Secretary, you don't seem
to have a clear picture

198
1:19:53,887 --> 1:19:58,557
of the enormous obstacles
confronting our forces.

199
1:19:59,225 --> 1:20:0,893
Do you realize, for example,

200
1:20:1,61 --> 1:20:5,439
regarding the route
the child took home,

201
1:20:5,815 --> 1:20:10,986
that there are 15 conflicting
eyewitness accounts alone?

202
1:20:11,154 --> 1:20:13,697
Let me give you a random example:

203
1:20:13,948 --> 1:20:17,826
"Testimony 1,478
in the Beckmann murder case..."

204
1:20:17,952 --> 1:20:19,995
- You've got no clue.
- More than you, mister!

205
1:20:20,121 --> 1:20:22,706
Gentlemen!

206
1:20:22,832 --> 1:20:26,877
You must at least know the color
of the cap the little girl wore

207
1:20:27,3 --> 1:20:29,755
whom you say you saw
with the stranger!

208
1:20:29,881 --> 1:20:31,757
Of course, Inspector.
It was red!

209
1:20:31,925 --> 1:20:34,885
- It was green!
- Red!

210
1:20:38,932 --> 1:20:41,934
Stop! This is pointless!

211
1:20:42,310 --> 1:20:45,354
Thank you, gentlemen.
- You're welcome!

212
1:20:45,939 --> 1:20:47,439
Next witness.

213
1:20:47,774 --> 1:20:51,151
If you rely
on a color-blind man for clues,

214
1:20:51,277 --> 1:20:53,654
don't be surprised
if you get nowhere!

215
1:20:53,780 --> 1:20:56,615
In their hunt
for this unknown killer,

216
1:20:56,866 --> 1:21:1,286
the police have tracked down
more than 1,500 detailed leads.

217
1:21:1,705 --> 1:21:5,582
The files in this case
fill 60 thick volumes.

218
1:21:5,917 --> 1:21:7,626
We've dispatched all our forces

219
1:21:7,794 --> 1:21:10,421
<i>to systematically comb
the area adjoining the city.</i>

220
1:21:10,964 --> 1:21:14,133
<i>Every piece of undergrowth is scoured,
every thicket searched,</i>

221
1:21:14,300 --> 1:21:16,51
<i>every bush examined,</i>

222
1:21:16,177 --> 1:21:19,471
<i>since any bush or hollow
could harbor some object</i>

223
1:21:19,597 --> 1:21:21,932
<i>that could finally set us
on the right track.</i>

224
1:21:22,892 --> 1:21:24,727
<i>We called in police dogs.</i>

225
1:21:24,853 --> 1:21:27,604
<i>We set the best trackers
on the faintest of traces,</i>

226
1:21:27,731 --> 1:21:29,273
<i>but they lost the scent</i>

227
1:21:29,399 --> 1:21:31,650
<i>and failed to pick it up again
despite all efforts.</i>

228
1:21:32,318 --> 1:21:33,736
<i>Since the first murders,</i>

229
1:21:33,862 --> 1:21:37,531
<i>the police have searched
homeless shelters night after night,</i>

230
1:21:37,782 --> 1:21:40,492
<i>subjecting everyone in them
to thorough scrutiny.</i>

231
1:21:41,35 --> 1:21:44,246
<i>This does not, of course,
make the police very popular,</i>

232
1:21:44,372 --> 1:21:46,665
<i>nor does it reduce
the general public's anxiety.</i>

233
1:21:47,125 --> 1:21:51,795
<i>Railway stations are kept
under surveillance around the clock.</i>

234
1:21:52,5 --> 1:21:56,8
<i>Still, the investigation has not yet
yielded the slightest results,</i>

235
1:21:56,176 --> 1:22:0,220
<i>nor have nightly raids
in the criminal districts.</i>

236
1:23:32,105 --> 1:23:33,605
The cops!

237
1:23:49,80 --> 1:23:50,122
<i>Get back!</i>

238
1:23:51,82 --> 1:23:53,250
<i>Back!
- This is the police!</i>

239
1:24:1,885 --> 1:24:4,177
<i>Let me go, you dirty bastard!</i>

240
1:24:4,512 --> 1:24:7,222
<i>Let me go, you son of a bitch!</i>

241
1:24:7,640 --> 1:24:10,809
Goddamn bastard!

242
1:24:12,270 --> 1:24:14,354
Put me down!

243
1:24:14,689 --> 1:24:16,481
Let me go!

244
1:24:16,649 --> 1:24:18,483
Let her go, you filthy pig!

245
1:24:21,571 --> 1:24:23,405
Quiet!

246
1:24:23,531 --> 1:24:24,781
Move back!

247
1:24:24,908 --> 1:24:26,909
The top fuzz!

248
1:24:28,77 --> 1:24:29,912
Quiet!

249
1:24:30,38 --> 1:24:31,997
Police orders:

250
1:24:32,123 --> 1:24:35,334
Nobody is to leave this establishment.
Get your papers ready.

251
1:24:45,11 --> 1:24:46,511
Please!

252
1:24:50,183 --> 1:24:53,143
Come now, children,
stop this foolishness.

253
1:24:53,811 --> 1:24:56,188
Well, if it isn't Tubby Lohmann!

254
1:25:7,784 --> 1:25:10,160
Quiet!

255
1:25:11,746 --> 1:25:13,246
That'll get you nowhere.

256
1:25:13,373 --> 1:25:16,208
- Go after the murderer instead!
- Right!

257
1:25:20,505 --> 1:25:21,546
Quiet!

258
1:25:22,548 --> 1:25:26,51
Be reasonable now!
Step back!

259
1:25:26,803 --> 1:25:28,720
You hear me? Step back!

260
1:25:28,888 --> 1:25:32,391
Let's go!
Come on, let's see those papers!

261
1:25:32,558 --> 1:25:35,477
<i>- I haven't got any.
- Let's see your papers.</i>

262
1:25:35,687 --> 1:25:37,896
<i>Please let me go, Inspector!</i>

263
1:25:38,147 --> 1:25:41,66
<i>The two guys who tried to escape
were caught on the Krangasse.</i>

264
1:25:41,317 --> 1:25:43,402
<i>- Leave those chairs alone!
- Shut up!</i>

265
1:25:43,569 --> 1:25:44,945
<i>Have your papers ready!</i>

266
1:25:45,113 --> 1:25:46,613
<i>Haven't we met before?
- Yeah. So?</i>

267
1:25:47,699 --> 1:25:49,324
<i>Off to the precinct again!</i>

268
1:25:49,575 --> 1:25:51,702
<i>Haven't even made a buck tonight!</i>

269
1:25:54,455 --> 1:25:57,416
<i>Anyone without papers
goes down to the precinct!</i>

270
1:25:57,583 --> 1:26:1,586
<i>I tell you, I'm innocent, really!</i>

271
1:26:1,713 --> 1:26:2,963
<i>Stop talking nonsense!</i>

272
1:26:3,214 --> 1:26:4,923
<i>- Let's get moving!
- Kiss my ass!</i>

273
1:26:5,49 --> 1:26:8,176
<i>- Show your papers!
- Where's the paddy wagon?</i>

274
1:26:8,302 --> 1:26:9,970
<i>Don't push.</i>

275
1:26:10,263 --> 1:26:12,97
<i>Everyone will get their turn.</i>

276
1:26:12,265 --> 1:26:14,474
<i>- Silence!
- Cool it, kids!</i>

277
1:26:14,600 --> 1:26:15,892
<i>Have your papers ready!</i>

278
1:26:17,103 --> 1:26:18,145
Your papers.

279
1:26:18,271 --> 1:26:21,356
Inspector, I can't carry my birth
certificate around with me everywhere!

280
1:26:21,482 --> 1:26:24,109
- Quit your bellyaching, child.
- I really can't, Inspector!

281
1:26:24,235 --> 1:26:25,736
The precinct for you!

282
1:26:25,987 --> 1:26:27,612
You make me puke!

283
1:27:16,329 --> 1:27:19,164
Shoddy work, my friend.

284
1:27:19,791 --> 1:27:21,833
You've been had.

285
1:27:22,502 --> 1:27:25,3
Precinct.
- See you, Willy. Ta-ta!

286
1:27:25,213 --> 1:27:27,589
Ah, lay off!

287
1:27:27,715 --> 1:27:28,882
Next.

288
1:27:31,344 --> 1:27:32,844
Stuck-up snob.

289
1:27:49,904 --> 1:27:51,530
What's wrong?

290
1:27:51,739 --> 1:27:54,699
- Papa Lohmann...
- ...nabbed him!

291
1:27:58,371 --> 1:28:1,206
UNSOLVED BURGLARY AT FURRIER'S

292
1:28:4,544 --> 1:28:6,753
We'd better take you
down to the precinct too.

293
1:28:6,879 --> 1:28:10,715
What do you mean?
My papers are in order.

294
1:28:10,842 --> 1:28:11,925
Move on.

295
1:28:12,135 --> 1:28:13,176
Move on!

296
1:28:13,302 --> 1:28:14,511
Ah, tough luck!

297
1:28:14,637 --> 1:28:16,12
Next.

298
1:28:19,183 --> 1:28:21,434
Papers.
- Don't got none.

299
1:28:21,561 --> 1:28:22,894
To the precinct.

300
1:28:23,62 --> 1:28:24,771
Just my luck.

301
1:28:25,22 --> 1:28:26,773
Next, come on.

302
1:29:41,15 --> 1:29:42,641
You're ruining my business, Sarge.

303
1:29:42,892 --> 1:29:44,726
These raids every night.

304
1:29:45,186 --> 1:29:48,313
No one can get a moment's peace!
They're human beings too.

305
1:29:48,564 --> 1:29:50,273
You think...

306
1:29:50,650 --> 1:29:54,653
we stay up all night
just for the hell of it?

307
1:29:54,820 --> 1:29:55,904
No.

308
1:29:56,30 --> 1:29:57,822
But you're drivin' away my clientele,

309
1:29:57,990 --> 1:30:0,742
and you won't find the guy
you're lookin' for here anyway.

310
1:30:2,161 --> 1:30:5,830
If you knew how steamed they are

311
1:30:6,82 --> 1:30:8,83
at the guy who's causing these raids.

312
1:30:8,376 --> 1:30:10,43
Especially the girls.

313
1:30:10,169 --> 1:30:12,879
Sure, they solicit.
Business is business.

314
1:30:13,422 --> 1:30:16,216
But believe me,

315
1:30:16,550 --> 1:30:19,636
in every one of them
beats a mother's heart!

316
1:30:19,845 --> 1:30:22,13
I know a lot of toughs

317
1:30:22,181 --> 1:30:25,976
who get all teary-eyed
just seein' the little ones at play.

318
1:30:26,435 --> 1:30:30,522
If they ever get their hands
on that monster,

319
1:30:30,648 --> 1:30:32,524
they'll make toothpicks out of him!

320
1:30:33,67 --> 1:30:34,985
Ready to leave, Sergeant.

321
1:30:35,111 --> 1:30:36,486
So long.

322
1:30:46,998 --> 1:30:49,499
They hit the Crocodile Club today.

323
1:30:50,710 --> 1:30:52,377
Two paddy wagons.

324
1:30:58,217 --> 1:31:0,552
What's keeping Safecracker?

325
1:31:2,930 --> 1:31:5,724
Is it 3:00 yet?

326
1:31:5,891 --> 1:31:7,600
I'll find out.

327
1:31:13,149 --> 1:31:15,233
The exact time, please, miss.

328
1:31:16,277 --> 1:31:18,778
2:58. Thank you.

329
1:31:36,714 --> 1:31:40,258
2:58.

330
1:32:8,746 --> 1:32:11,998
The cops are crawling
the streets like ants again.

331
1:32:13,793 --> 1:32:15,543
Green coats wherever you spit.

332
1:32:15,669 --> 1:32:18,171
They're on your back
even if you're with a broad.

333
1:32:18,297 --> 1:32:21,216
They've gone nuts...
got this murderer on the brain.

334
1:32:21,759 --> 1:32:25,678
My old lady has a little six-year-old girl,
and every night I have to check

335
1:32:25,805 --> 1:32:29,599
under the bed to see
if the murderer's hiding there.

336
1:32:30,142 --> 1:32:33,561
You can't do business anymore
for tripping over cops everywhere.

337
1:32:33,771 --> 1:32:37,649
There's no privacy anymore.
I'm fed up with it.

338
1:32:38,526 --> 1:32:40,443
What else is new?

339
1:32:46,283 --> 1:32:49,619
- Where the heck is Safecracker?
- Think they might have nabbed him?

340
1:32:50,79 --> 1:32:52,330
That guy? Come on.

341
1:32:52,498 --> 1:32:57,669
Scotland Yard laid a trap for him once
on a bank job he pulled in London.

342
1:32:57,837 --> 1:33:1,339
There he was, hands up,
back to the wall,

343
1:33:1,632 --> 1:33:4,759
cops all around him.

344
1:33:5,428 --> 1:33:7,846
Seconds later there were
three men dead on the ground,

345
1:33:8,13 --> 1:33:9,931
but he wasn't one of 'em!

346
1:33:10,57 --> 1:33:12,642
No one better
from Berlin to San Francisco.

347
1:33:13,60 --> 1:33:16,312
They've been after him six years
and they've yet to get him.

348
1:33:16,439 --> 1:33:19,65
Not yet. But put enough dogs
on the fox's tail...

349
1:33:19,316 --> 1:33:21,25
Can it!

350
1:33:29,618 --> 1:33:30,785
Damn it!

351
1:33:32,746 --> 1:33:34,456
I can't take this!

352
1:33:35,624 --> 1:33:37,792
He was always right on time before.

353
1:33:40,880 --> 1:33:42,881
- Thank God!
- Finally.

354
1:33:44,967 --> 1:33:46,634
Morning!

355
1:33:46,760 --> 1:33:49,95
Are you nuts?
Close those blinds!

356
1:34:12,161 --> 1:34:14,954
Gentlemen,
I hereby open this meeting.

357
1:34:15,80 --> 1:34:19,417
I declare all division leaders
of this organization present.

358
1:34:20,336 --> 1:34:22,420
I assume you're authorized
to make binding decisions

359
1:34:22,546 --> 1:34:25,256
for your divisions.

360
1:34:26,759 --> 1:34:29,260
Good. We'll dispense
with the preliminaries,

361
1:34:29,386 --> 1:34:31,804
as we all know why we're here.

362
1:34:32,890 --> 1:34:36,935
An outsider is ruining
our business and our reputation.

363
1:34:37,895 --> 1:34:39,646
Measures taken by the police

364
1:34:39,772 --> 1:34:44,234
and the daily raids
to catch this child murderer

365
1:34:44,610 --> 1:34:48,71
are hampering our activities
to an almost unbearable degree.

366
1:34:48,948 --> 1:34:50,949
We can no longer tolerate the fact

367
1:34:51,116 --> 1:34:56,162
that we're not safe now in any hotel,
bar, café or even private home

368
1:34:56,288 --> 1:34:58,790
from the clutches of the police.

369
1:34:58,916 --> 1:34:59,999
Very true.

370
1:35:0,125 --> 1:35:2,252
This state of affairs must end.

371
1:35:2,378 --> 1:35:6,47
Things must return to normal
or we'll go under.

372
1:35:7,216 --> 1:35:9,801
Our coffers will soon be depleted.

373
1:35:10,302 --> 1:35:13,388
If we can't get funds to support
the wives of those members

374
1:35:14,223 --> 1:35:17,141
who currently enjoy
room and board at state expense,

375
1:35:17,601 --> 1:35:22,939
I don't know where we'll find
the money to carry out our plans.

376
1:35:23,107 --> 1:35:25,149
Our reputation is suffering as well.

377
1:35:25,317 --> 1:35:28,152
The police seek
the murderer in our fold.

378
1:35:29,488 --> 1:35:32,532
Gentlemen, when I run head-on
into an officer from the squad,

379
1:35:32,658 --> 1:35:35,201
he knows the potential risks,
and so do I.

380
1:35:35,494 --> 1:35:38,663
If either dies in the line of duty, fine.
Occupational hazard.

381
1:35:39,81 --> 1:35:42,667
But we must draw a firm line
between ourselves

382
1:35:42,793 --> 1:35:45,545
and this man they're looking for!

383
1:35:45,671 --> 1:35:47,839
We conduct our business
in order to survive,

384
1:35:47,965 --> 1:35:50,300
but this monster
has no right to survive!

385
1:35:50,426 --> 1:35:52,552
He must be killed,
eliminated, exterminated!

386
1:35:52,678 --> 1:35:54,971
Without mercy or compassion!

387
1:35:58,851 --> 1:36:0,643
Gentlemen,

388
1:36:1,353 --> 1:36:4,355
our members must be able
to go about their business again

389
1:36:4,940 --> 1:36:9,986
without frantic cops
in their way at every turn.

390
1:36:10,362 --> 1:36:11,487
I invite...

391
1:36:13,73 --> 1:36:16,200
...your views, gentlemen.

392
1:36:18,537 --> 1:36:22,415
Step up ID checks,
comb the entire city,

393
1:36:22,541 --> 1:36:27,45
and raids...
relentless, ever tougher raids!

394
1:36:27,838 --> 1:36:30,214
We need informers!

395
1:36:30,382 --> 1:36:33,551
We must know the police's plans
almost before they do themselves!

396
1:36:33,677 --> 1:36:35,678
The girls gotta work the cops more!

397
1:36:36,55 --> 1:36:40,266
How often has one of us been nabbed
'cause his gal ratted on him to the cops?

398
1:36:40,726 --> 1:36:42,352
Now they can rat on the cops!

399
1:36:42,478 --> 1:36:46,648
Every resident, every landlord,

400
1:36:47,66 --> 1:36:50,652
every property owner

401
1:36:50,944 --> 1:36:56,574
must be forced to consent
to meticulous searches of his property

402
1:36:56,784 --> 1:37:0,78
for the slightest of clues.

403
1:37:1,80 --> 1:37:4,457
What if we...
We have our connections.

404
1:37:5,626 --> 1:37:9,962
What if we put
an article in the papers

405
1:37:10,589 --> 1:37:14,926
that our syndicates...
I mean, our organization...

406
1:37:15,427 --> 1:37:19,55
doesn't wish to be lumped in
together with this pig,

407
1:37:19,181 --> 1:37:22,100
and that the cops should look
for this guy somewhere else.

408
1:37:22,267 --> 1:37:23,810
He's not even a real crook!

409
1:37:24,103 --> 1:37:26,562
This man may well be...

410
1:37:27,272 --> 1:37:31,67
when not engaged
in the actual act of killing...

411
1:37:32,111 --> 1:37:36,30
a harmless, upstanding citizen

412
1:37:36,156 --> 1:37:37,657
who wouldn't hurt a fly.

413
1:37:37,783 --> 1:37:41,452
In his right mind, perhaps he plays
marbles with his landlady's kids

414
1:37:41,578 --> 1:37:43,788
or plays cards with friends.

415
1:37:43,914 --> 1:37:47,667
Without what I'll call

416
1:37:47,835 --> 1:37:50,670
the innocuousness
of these murderers' private lives,

417
1:37:50,796 --> 1:37:55,299
it's inconceivable that someone
like Grossmann or Haarmann

418
1:37:55,426 --> 1:37:59,637
could have lived right next door
to their neighbors for years

419
1:37:59,972 --> 1:38:3,641
without arousing
the faintest trace of suspicion!

420
1:38:3,809 --> 1:38:6,811
This is where we must focus
the public's attention.

421
1:38:6,937 --> 1:38:9,147
The public must cooperate.

422
1:38:9,565 --> 1:38:12,692
I'll tell you about public cooperation!

423
1:38:13,110 --> 1:38:15,945
Just thinking of it makes me puke.

424
1:38:17,197 --> 1:38:18,948
I beg your pardon, Commissioner.

425
1:38:19,74 --> 1:38:22,410
But ain't it the truth?

426
1:38:23,370 --> 1:38:26,831
What the devil has public cooperation
gotten us so far?

427
1:38:29,251 --> 1:38:32,3
Piles of letters
full of the most outrageous slander!

428
1:38:32,129 --> 1:38:33,504
Very true.

429
1:38:33,672 --> 1:38:36,758
They alert homicide
whenever a chimney sweep walks by.

430
1:38:36,884 --> 1:38:38,217
That's right.

431
1:38:38,343 --> 1:38:41,304
But when you really want
reliable information from them,

432
1:38:42,139 --> 1:38:44,56
then they suddenly haven't got a clue.

433
1:38:44,433 --> 1:38:47,894
Why, they just can't seem
to remember a thing.

434
1:38:49,396 --> 1:38:52,356
There's your public cooperation
for you!

435
1:38:53,442 --> 1:38:56,360
I believe you're exaggerating a bit,
Lohmann.

436
1:38:57,362 --> 1:38:59,822
It can't really be that bad, can it?

437
1:39:0,324 --> 1:39:2,867
But it is, Commissioner!

438
1:39:3,368 --> 1:39:7,205
Most of the public
still takes the position,

439
1:39:7,414 --> 1:39:9,415
"How does this concern me?"

440
1:39:10,250 --> 1:39:14,295
The idea that
each individual is responsible

441
1:39:14,421 --> 1:39:18,382
for what happens to the poorest,
most anonymous child on the street

442
1:39:18,550 --> 1:39:22,345
hasn't even dawned
on the public at large!

443
1:39:25,724 --> 1:39:27,350
I've got another idea.

444
1:39:27,476 --> 1:39:29,393
There was this magician.

445
1:39:29,520 --> 1:39:33,64
Te... Tele...
I can't remember what you call it.

446
1:39:33,357 --> 1:39:36,442
Anyway, he could conjure up
hidden pennies out of handkerchiefs.

447
1:39:36,568 --> 1:39:39,612
The reward is still
far too little money.

448
1:39:41,406 --> 1:39:46,244
The man who leads us
to the murderer should get a fortune.

449
1:39:46,411 --> 1:39:48,788
None of this is anything new.

450
1:39:48,914 --> 1:39:50,706
This is all leading nowhere.

451
1:39:51,208 --> 1:39:55,86
So we just wait for the police
to catch the guy instead?

452
1:39:58,90 --> 1:40:1,926
The difficulties
in solving crimes of this nature

453
1:40:2,52 --> 1:40:5,388
are, in my experience,
often insurmountable,

454
1:40:5,931 --> 1:40:8,224
since perpetrator and victim

455
1:40:8,350 --> 1:40:12,19
are often brought together
by mere chance.

456
1:40:12,312 --> 1:40:15,857
The instincts of the moment
drive the murderer's actions.

457
1:40:16,108 --> 1:40:19,735
The victim is found and identified,

458
1:40:20,112 --> 1:40:22,280
his or her last known whereabouts
are determined,

459
1:40:22,447 --> 1:40:24,156
and then...

460
1:40:25,409 --> 1:40:28,619
then comes the big question mark.

461
1:40:30,289 --> 1:40:33,40
These children vanish
without a trace.

462
1:40:35,752 --> 1:40:38,212
And when they're found...

463
1:40:41,925 --> 1:40:46,679
Well, we all know the state
in which we've found them.

464
1:40:49,308 --> 1:40:51,350
And the perpetrator...

465
1:40:53,645 --> 1:40:55,605
It's a fact well-known to all of us

466
1:40:55,731 --> 1:40:59,734
that murderers like this
rarely leave a clue behind.

467
1:41:0,193 --> 1:41:4,155
That's what makes our work so hard,
our successes so few.

468
1:41:4,281 --> 1:41:7,867
The police have been after
this murderer for eight months now.

469
1:41:9,453 --> 1:41:12,705
They'll only get him by accident now.
- We can't wait for that.

470
1:41:12,873 --> 1:41:15,333
No, we'll go broke by then.

471
1:41:15,500 --> 1:41:16,626
What, then?

472
1:41:34,61 --> 1:41:35,937
We have to catch him...

473
1:41:37,147 --> 1:41:38,689
ourselves.

474
1:41:43,403 --> 1:41:45,905
Yes, that's what we must do.

475
1:41:47,240 --> 1:41:51,619
There is perhaps one other way.

476
1:41:52,162 --> 1:41:55,247
I'm quite certain that information
on the individual in question

477
1:41:55,374 --> 1:42:0,878
must already exist somewhere.

478
1:42:1,88 --> 1:42:5,49
Being the severely pathological case
that he is,

479
1:42:5,217 --> 1:42:9,720
he has no doubt already had some kind
of contact with the authorities.

480
1:42:10,931 --> 1:42:14,308
That's why all health care facilities,

481
1:42:14,643 --> 1:42:18,229
prisons, clinics and insane asylums

482
1:42:18,563 --> 1:42:22,316
must be encouraged
to cooperate with us unequivocally.

483
1:42:23,26 --> 1:42:26,70
We specifically need information

484
1:42:26,238 --> 1:42:30,658
on those released after being deemed
harmless to society

485
1:42:30,993 --> 1:42:34,328
but who, due to their inclinations,

486
1:42:34,746 --> 1:42:37,415
could be the murderer.

487
1:42:37,582 --> 1:42:40,793
We must cover the city
with a net of informers.

488
1:42:42,254 --> 1:42:45,923
Every square mile must be
under constant surveillance.

489
1:42:46,174 --> 1:42:49,677
No child in this city must take
a single step without us knowing it.

490
1:42:49,803 --> 1:42:52,179
- Fine, but how?
- And who?

491
1:42:52,305 --> 1:42:56,17
It must be people who can go
anywhere without causing a stir,

492
1:42:56,143 --> 1:42:59,270
follow anyone
without attracting attention,

493
1:42:59,438 --> 1:43:3,441
follow any child to any house
without arousing suspicion.

494
1:43:3,775 --> 1:43:7,945
In short, people whom the killer
would never suspect.

495
1:43:8,71 --> 1:43:10,281
- But who?
- There are no such people!

496
1:43:10,449 --> 1:43:12,450
- Who could do that?
- Who?

497
1:43:16,747 --> 1:43:17,997
The beggars.

498
1:43:18,498 --> 1:43:20,750
The organization of beggars!

499
1:43:50,947 --> 1:43:53,449
MR. CREDIT IS DEAD AND BURIED -
THE MANAGEMENT

500
1:43:59,998 --> 1:44:1,957
Blood pudding's on the upswing.

501
1:44:4,503 --> 1:44:7,4
God, this cheese stinks so good.

502
1:44:13,678 --> 1:44:15,679
Take that, you sons of bitches!

503
1:44:25,482 --> 1:44:28,776
Hey, stop snoring.
You'll wake up the lice.

504
1:44:38,370 --> 1:44:39,870
Two, four, six...

505
1:44:41,957 --> 1:44:44,333
NO BEGGARS OR PEDDLERS

506
1:44:47,546 --> 1:44:50,422
SANDWICHES

507
1:44:59,57 --> 1:45:1,433
Bread-and-butter sandwich,
lukewarm response.

508
1:45:3,937 --> 1:45:7,106
Black Friday for roast beef.

509
1:45:27,127 --> 1:45:29,628
All right.
Now come the courtyards.

510
1:45:30,422 --> 1:45:34,592
Yes, from number 1 to 88.

511
1:45:37,971 --> 1:45:39,513
Next.

512
1:45:44,769 --> 1:45:48,397
You're responsible for the courtyards
on Hauptstrasse from 1 to 88.

513
1:45:48,523 --> 1:45:50,65
Got it.

514
1:45:50,192 --> 1:45:51,609
What's next?

515
1:45:51,735 --> 1:45:55,112
Hauptstrasse, from number 89...

516
1:45:56,406 --> 1:45:57,698
to 196.

517
1:45:57,824 --> 1:45:59,909
Hauptstrasse,

518
1:46:0,243 --> 1:46:4,455
number 89 to 196.

519
1:46:5,81 --> 1:46:9,293
Member number?
- 3795. Emil Dustermann.

520
1:46:25,644 --> 1:46:28,270
Well, Emil, maybe
you'll win the 15,000.

521
1:46:28,396 --> 1:46:30,814
I've got my fingers crossed.

522
1:46:31,274 --> 1:46:32,650
Knock on wood.

523
1:47:14,693 --> 1:47:17,236
My heartfelt thanks,
ladies and gentlemen.

524
1:47:19,656 --> 1:47:21,657
Thank you.

525
1:48:13,585 --> 1:48:16,628
"In searching homes,
be on the lookout for any clue

526
1:48:17,130 --> 1:48:20,591
which could establish the origin
of the murderer's letter to the Courier.

527
1:48:21,51 --> 1:48:22,760
Be on the lookout as well

528
1:48:23,53 --> 1:48:26,55
for an old wooden table..."

529
1:48:27,223 --> 1:48:28,682
Idiot!

530
1:48:34,272 --> 1:48:35,939
"...or red pencil..."

531
1:48:36,983 --> 1:48:38,359
Come in.

532
1:48:39,402 --> 1:48:43,113
"... or writing paper
of the type used by the killer".

533
1:48:44,115 --> 1:48:48,952
Inspector, here are reports on mental
patients who've been released as cured

534
1:48:49,120 --> 1:48:51,997
or deemed harmless
over the last five years.

535
1:48:52,123 --> 1:48:54,333
Reports from every
private and public institute,

536
1:48:54,459 --> 1:48:57,669
as well as from
municipal hospitals and asylums.

537
1:49:9,933 --> 1:49:14,103
And here's a list
of their present addresses.

538
1:49:50,14 --> 1:49:53,16
Good day.
Does a Mr. Beckert live here?

539
1:49:53,143 --> 1:49:54,351
Pardon me?

540
1:49:54,561 --> 1:49:57,62
Does a Mr. Beckert live here?

541
1:49:57,272 --> 1:50:0,357
I'm afraid I don't understand.
I'm a bit hard of hearing.

542
1:50:0,525 --> 1:50:2,234
You don't say.

543
1:50:2,569 --> 1:50:5,154
Does a Mr. Beckert live here?

544
1:50:5,447 --> 1:50:9,950
Mr. Beckert... yes, he does.
But he just stepped out.

545
1:50:10,201 --> 1:50:13,328
I had hoped to speak with him.

546
1:50:14,122 --> 1:50:16,498
I'm from the tax office.

547
1:50:16,708 --> 1:50:19,1
The tax office. Oh, my Lord!

548
1:50:19,210 --> 1:50:21,837
Perhaps you'd like to wait for him...

549
1:50:21,963 --> 1:50:23,714
Yes, thank you.

550
1:50:31,556 --> 1:50:34,808
- Please have a seat.
- Thank you.

551
1:50:47,739 --> 1:50:51,283
- Perhaps you'd like something to read.
- Thank you. Most kind.

552
1:50:51,409 --> 1:50:54,286
THE GENERAL GAZETTE

553
1:50:54,662 --> 1:50:56,121
Tell me, Mrs. Winkler,

554
1:50:56,623 --> 1:50:59,41
does Mr. Beckert
subscribe to any newspapers?

555
1:50:59,417 --> 1:51:2,920
Mr. Beckert?
No, he always borrows mine.

556
1:51:3,338 --> 1:51:5,631
I see. Thank you.

557
1:54:18,825 --> 1:54:22,327
Mommy!
I wanted to meet you halfway!

558
1:54:22,578 --> 1:54:25,122
Child, you mustn't do that.

559
1:54:25,498 --> 1:54:27,40
You know why.

560
1:55:11,794 --> 1:55:13,670
Good day.
What would you like?

561
1:55:13,880 --> 1:55:15,380
Coffee.

562
1:55:16,48 --> 1:55:19,217
No, a vermouth.
No, a cognac.

563
1:55:45,36 --> 1:55:46,536
Here you are.

564
1:55:52,335 --> 1:55:53,752
Another.

565
1:56:27,829 --> 1:56:29,412
Check.

566
1:56:29,747 --> 1:56:32,541
Two cognacs...
that's 1.65, please.

567
1:56:35,461 --> 1:56:36,920
Thank you very much.

568
1:56:43,94 --> 1:56:46,847
Number 24: Beckert.
Doesn't take the Courier.

569
1:56:46,973 --> 1:56:49,599
Table: polished mahogany,
with tablecloth.

570
1:56:49,767 --> 1:56:53,436
No traces of red pencil.
In fact, no writing materials of any kind.

571
1:56:53,771 --> 1:56:55,313
Printed matter found in wastebasket:

572
1:56:55,439 --> 1:56:57,482
cigar ad and a postcard

573
1:56:58,109 --> 1:56:59,818
with flowers
and "Regards, Paul" on it,

574
1:56:59,944 --> 1:57:1,778
but no address of sender.

575
1:57:1,904 --> 1:57:5,282
An empty cigarette pack, Ariston brand,
a bag of candy...

576
1:57:9,36 --> 1:57:10,871
Just a moment.

577
1:57:14,292 --> 1:57:16,293
Ariston?

578
1:57:27,513 --> 1:57:29,556
What was that?

579
1:57:39,400 --> 1:57:45,280
I'd like the file
on the Marga Perl murder case.

580
1:57:47,533 --> 1:57:49,326
Thank you very much.

581
1:57:57,293 --> 1:57:59,44
That's odd.

582
1:58:0,296 --> 1:58:2,964
I've heard that before.

583
1:58:6,10 --> 1:58:7,594
It was...

584
1:58:10,431 --> 1:58:12,57
It was...

585
1:58:32,36 --> 1:58:33,912
<i>Hey, Heinrich!</i>

586
1:58:39,418 --> 1:58:41,294
What is it?

587
1:58:42,964 --> 1:58:46,758
What's wrong?
- Listen. Someone's whistling.

588
1:58:48,52 --> 1:58:49,761
Can't you hear it?

589
1:58:50,54 --> 1:58:51,346
There.

590
1:58:53,933 --> 1:58:55,475
Now he's stopped.

591
1:58:57,61 --> 1:58:59,479
Did you see
the guy who was whistling?

592
1:58:59,605 --> 1:59:1,940
Yes, I can still see him.

593
1:59:2,66 --> 1:59:7,696
Heinrich, he's talking to a little girl
and walking her down the street.

594
1:59:7,905 --> 1:59:11,825
- After him, quick, and don't lose him!
- Why?

595
1:59:12,76 --> 1:59:16,329
The day little Elsie Beckmann
was killed,

596
1:59:16,455 --> 1:59:19,165
a man bought a balloon from me.

597
1:59:19,291 --> 1:59:22,335
He was with a little girl...

598
1:59:26,90 --> 1:59:31,261
and he whistled just like that!

599
2:1:0,184 --> 2:1:1,643
Damn it, man!

600
2:1:1,852 --> 2:1:4,813
Are you crazy,
throwing orange peels on the ground?

601
2:1:4,939 --> 2:1:7,190
A man could slip and break his neck!
Unbelievable!

602
2:1:7,316 --> 2:1:9,567
I should report you to the police!

603
2:1:9,819 --> 2:1:12,320
Outrageous behavior!

604
2:1:14,240 --> 2:1:15,740
Hey, mister.

605
2:1:29,46 --> 2:1:30,797
Aha! Here it is.

606
2:1:31,48 --> 2:1:36,928
"In a 150-foot radius
of the crime scene,

607
2:1:37,54 --> 2:1:40,306
three cigarette butts of the Ariston brand
were found". There you have it.

608
2:1:41,16 --> 2:1:43,977
Yes, it may be
the same brand of cigarettes,

609
2:1:45,20 --> 2:1:47,564
but there was no old wooden table.

610
2:1:48,566 --> 2:1:54,70
Of course, he could have written
that letter somewhere else.

611
2:1:58,784 --> 2:2:0,493
Good God!

612
2:2:1,912 --> 2:2:3,371
<i>The window ledge!</i>

613
2:2:16,719 --> 2:2:18,344
You're right.

614
2:2:20,431 --> 2:2:22,348
Just a minute.

615
2:2:29,899 --> 2:2:31,65
Red pencil.

616
2:2:34,278 --> 2:2:36,29
My God, finally!

617
2:2:37,448 --> 2:2:39,908
We're finally on his trail.

618
2:2:42,661 --> 2:2:43,912
What?

619
2:2:44,705 --> 2:2:46,623
They're on his trail?

620
2:2:47,791 --> 2:2:50,543
<i>- Did they find him?
- The beggars found him.</i>

621
2:2:50,794 --> 2:2:53,129
- His whistling gave him away.
- They put a mark on him.

622
2:2:53,255 --> 2:2:54,672
Shut up!

623
2:2:55,132 --> 2:2:56,758
What did you say?

624
2:2:56,884 --> 2:3:0,970
They're following the mark.
He isn't out of sight for a second.

625
2:3:2,640 --> 2:3:5,141
<i>His every move is being watched.</i>

626
2:4:12,626 --> 2:4:14,419
- Mister.
- What is it?

627
2:4:14,545 --> 2:4:17,380
- You got some white stuff on your coat.
- Where?

628
2:4:17,965 --> 2:4:19,757
On your shoulder.

629
2:4:24,555 --> 2:4:26,764
Here, I'll wipe it off.

630
2:4:33,564 --> 2:4:36,357
- What's the matter?
- Come on. We're leaving.

631
2:6:8,450 --> 2:6:10,993
He didn't come out this way.
We would've seen him.

632
2:6:11,161 --> 2:6:12,286
Out of the question!

633
2:6:12,413 --> 2:6:16,416
- Well, he didn't turn back.
- He has to be somewhere, damn it!

634
2:6:20,671 --> 2:6:23,840
Maybe he's hiding
inside the building.

635
2:6:44,278 --> 2:6:45,528
Closing time!

636
2:6:45,654 --> 2:6:49,824
We can't let him get away in the crowd!
If he slips through now...

637
2:6:50,159 --> 2:6:51,534
They're starting to come out!

638
2:6:51,660 --> 2:6:54,36
Out in the street,
and keep your eyes peeled!

639
2:7:2,754 --> 2:7:4,714
Excuse me, may I ask you a question?

640
2:7:6,133 --> 2:7:8,551
My trip is tomorrow.
I start in Königsberg...

641
2:7:10,429 --> 2:7:13,264
No, in my condition
I can't eat anything like that...

642
2:7:13,515 --> 2:7:16,392
The boss came to my office today...

643
2:7:18,687 --> 2:7:20,521
Turn off the light.

644
2:7:20,647 --> 2:7:23,941
He'll get suspicious
if he comes home and sees it on.

645
2:7:28,655 --> 2:7:30,531
What time is it, anyway?

646
2:7:32,159 --> 2:7:33,951
Almost 6:30.

647
2:7:51,762 --> 2:7:54,222
He's gotta still be inside!

648
2:7:54,348 --> 2:7:57,600
He definitely didn't come out
with the office crowd.

649
2:8:5,442 --> 2:8:7,151
No, just a moment.

650
2:8:8,153 --> 2:8:10,988
The beggars have called for backup
and surrounded the whole building.

651
2:8:11,114 --> 2:8:13,908
They figure the guy's hiding
in the building.

652
2:8:19,373 --> 2:8:21,207
What sort of building is it?

653
2:8:22,834 --> 2:8:25,2
What sort of building is it?

654
2:8:25,128 --> 2:8:27,713
Nothing but offices.

655
2:8:29,91 --> 2:8:31,133
I don't know what's in the basement.

656
2:8:31,802 --> 2:8:34,762
There's a branch of the local
savings bank on the ground floor,

657
2:8:35,97 --> 2:8:39,308
and the second to sixth floors
are nothing but offices.

658
2:8:39,434 --> 2:8:41,18
Above that is the attic space.

659
2:8:46,817 --> 2:8:48,651
This is unbelievable.

660
2:8:50,445 --> 2:8:52,113
Anyone still in there?

661
2:9:0,38 --> 2:9:1,664
Anyone still in here?

662
2:9:20,684 --> 2:9:22,268
What the devil!

663
2:9:23,20 --> 2:9:24,687
Anybody still in here?

664
2:9:34,698 --> 2:9:36,907
Damn carelessness!

665
2:9:40,162 --> 2:9:41,621
All that trouble for one door.

666
2:10:4,603 --> 2:10:6,479
Seems the guy's cornered now.

667
2:10:6,730 --> 2:10:9,398
I think we should tip
the cops off right away.

668
2:10:9,524 --> 2:10:11,609
- I agree.
- Let's not waste time!

669
2:10:13,70 --> 2:10:17,114
Stay by the phone
and call back in a few minutes.

670
2:10:17,366 --> 2:10:18,699
What is it?

671
2:10:18,867 --> 2:10:21,202
Are you crazy or something?
The police?

672
2:10:21,536 --> 2:10:24,205
No! We're gonna get
this guy ourselves!

673
2:10:24,414 --> 2:10:26,82
Listen, the time now is...

674
2:10:27,584 --> 2:10:28,459
8:00.

675
2:10:28,585 --> 2:10:32,880
All right. 9:00... 10:00...

676
2:10:33,131 --> 2:10:34,256
At 11:00!

677
2:10:58,407 --> 2:11:2,76
Evening. Did you know
your gate isn't closed?

678
2:11:2,202 --> 2:11:4,829
What? That's impossible!

679
2:11:5,455 --> 2:11:8,499
Why I just... Wait, it is!

680
2:11:11,294 --> 2:11:13,963
Open up, quick!
And not a sound!

681
2:11:14,89 --> 2:11:16,298
Come on! Move it!

682
2:11:16,633 --> 2:11:18,718
Let's go!

683
2:11:18,844 --> 2:11:20,761
Come on, move it!

684
2:11:48,665 --> 2:11:51,125
How many other watchmen
are in the building?

685
2:11:54,87 --> 2:11:56,213
Don't want to answer, eh?

686
2:11:57,841 --> 2:11:59,467
Very well.

687
2:12:33,168 --> 2:12:35,211
There are still two watchmen
on their rounds.

688
2:12:58,860 --> 2:13:0,736
Goddamn it!

689
2:13:0,904 --> 2:13:3,697
Damn piece of crap!

690
2:13:10,497 --> 2:13:12,581
Goddamned lock!

691
2:13:26,429 --> 2:13:28,514
Damn it to hell!

692
2:13:28,807 --> 2:13:30,266
Shit!

693
2:14:25,488 --> 2:14:28,157
Careful where you shine those lights!

694
2:14:28,408 --> 2:14:31,35
And don't stomp around
like elephants!

695
2:14:31,161 --> 2:14:32,953
He's not in the basement.

696
2:14:33,79 --> 2:14:35,289
We went through it all
and found nothing.

697
2:14:36,166 --> 2:14:38,834
Two men are still going
through the boiler room.

698
2:14:39,419 --> 2:14:40,628
Hold it!

699
2:14:40,754 --> 2:14:42,338
This is the last one.

700
2:14:42,589 --> 2:14:45,174
Go up and join Emil.
He needs help.

701
2:14:52,807 --> 2:14:54,350
Safecracker sent me.

702
2:14:54,601 --> 2:14:55,684
All right.

703
2:14:56,561 --> 2:14:57,853
Listen carefully.

704
2:14:58,355 --> 2:15:2,650
This is a new type of time clock.

705
2:15:3,443 --> 2:15:5,694
Here's a general diagram.

706
2:15:5,946 --> 2:15:8,322
If they're not set
at exactly the right minute,

707
2:15:8,448 --> 2:15:12,493
an alarm automatically goes off
at the nearest police station. Get it?

708
2:15:15,288 --> 2:15:16,830
You got it?

709
2:15:16,957 --> 2:15:19,708
- I'm not an idiot!
- Well...

710
2:15:21,503 --> 2:15:25,172
He's not in the boiler room
or the coal room.

711
2:15:25,298 --> 2:15:27,424
We turned over every piece of coal.

712
2:15:30,679 --> 2:15:31,845
Hey!

713
2:15:32,222 --> 2:15:34,765
Are you nuts?

714
2:15:34,891 --> 2:15:39,728
What if the doors are wired?
You want the police here in five minutes?

715
2:15:41,272 --> 2:15:44,942
We gotta get in if we're gonna
search the whole place!

716
2:15:45,193 --> 2:15:47,403
But not through the door, you idiot!

717
2:15:47,570 --> 2:15:49,780
Go through the ceiling
of the office above!

718
2:15:56,413 --> 2:15:57,705
Nothing.

719
2:16:33,867 --> 2:16:35,909
All right. Down we go.

720
2:17:26,461 --> 2:17:28,504
Hey, what's up?

721
2:17:29,5 --> 2:17:30,506
Hey! What is it?

722
2:17:30,632 --> 2:17:32,883
Wait a minute!
Answer me, damn it!

723
2:17:33,9 --> 2:17:35,511
What's going on?
- I heard some banging!

724
2:17:36,805 --> 2:17:40,57
- Where are you off to?
- Why are you running?

725
2:17:44,729 --> 2:17:46,647
<i>Wait, damn it!</i>

726
2:17:47,982 --> 2:17:49,858
I've gotta see Safecracker!

727
2:17:50,26 --> 2:17:54,279
He's in the attic, I tell you!
I heard him knocking!

728
2:18:11,297 --> 2:18:12,381
Quiet!

729
2:19:1,764 --> 2:19:4,266
Go on! He has to be in there!

730
2:19:5,310 --> 2:19:7,102
Here's the light switch.

731
2:19:9,105 --> 2:19:10,898
Force the locks.

732
2:19:11,357 --> 2:19:12,774
Come on. Hurry up!

733
2:19:24,454 --> 2:19:27,998
Got him! I found the guy!
He's in the attic!

734
2:19:28,124 --> 2:19:30,626
I heard someone banging,
and I told Safecracker.

735
2:19:30,793 --> 2:19:33,795
He's up there with eight men.
They'll get him any moment now.

736
2:19:33,922 --> 2:19:36,89
Just came down to fill you in.

737
2:19:36,216 --> 2:19:39,176
If I hadn't been alert,
we could've looked for him for hours!

738
2:19:39,302 --> 2:19:40,469
The watchman!

739
2:19:45,767 --> 2:19:48,435
Three... one... four.

740
2:19:48,811 --> 2:19:50,312
314.

741
2:20:2,450 --> 2:20:4,826
- Everybody out!
- What?

742
2:20:4,994 --> 2:20:8,997
- The cops'll be here in five minutes.
- Damn it! Who called 'em?

743
2:20:9,123 --> 2:20:11,333
- The watchman rang the alarm.
- Let's scram!

744
2:20:11,668 --> 2:20:12,918
Hold it!

745
2:20:13,169 --> 2:20:14,628
Quiet down!

746
2:20:15,505 --> 2:20:18,131
Five more minutes,
six more storage sheds.

747
2:20:18,258 --> 2:20:20,509
Move it! Get going!

748
2:20:20,802 --> 2:20:23,220
Not like that!
Out of the way!

749
2:20:31,187 --> 2:20:33,230
<i>- He's not in here.
- Next door!</i>

750
2:20:33,940 --> 2:20:35,565
<i>Come on! Faster!</i>

751
2:20:40,321 --> 2:20:43,31
<i>- He's not here either.
- Move on! Next door!</i>

752
2:20:49,539 --> 2:20:52,708
<i>Quickly! We've only got
three minutes left!</i>

753
2:20:54,127 --> 2:20:56,128
<i>No padlock on this one...
he must be here!</i>

754
2:20:56,212 --> 2:20:57,296
<i>Open it!</i>

755
2:20:57,422 --> 2:20:59,339
<i>- Something's jammed inside.
- Let me do it!</i>

756
2:20:59,465 --> 2:21:1,591
<i>Hurry! Only one minute left!</i>

757
2:21:5,930 --> 2:21:8,432
<i>There he is, the dog!</i>

758
2:21:9,100 --> 2:21:11,685
Come on! Move it!

759
2:21:13,730 --> 2:21:15,147
Everybody out!

760
2:21:16,65 --> 2:21:18,108
Get out while you can, damn it!

761
2:21:18,318 --> 2:21:20,193
Move it!

762
2:21:22,113 --> 2:21:24,364
For Christ's sake, get going!

763
2:21:25,825 --> 2:21:27,743
What's keeping the others?
- They're coming!

764
2:21:27,910 --> 2:21:32,247
If not, they might as well stay here,
with or without the guy!

765
2:21:33,82 --> 2:21:35,876
What in the hell is keeping them?

766
2:21:36,127 --> 2:21:38,86
Finally! Thank God!

767
2:21:38,629 --> 2:21:43,300
Quick now! Go!
Make it snappy!

768
2:22:17,377 --> 2:22:19,252
<i>He's not down here.</i>

769
2:22:20,797 --> 2:22:24,299
<i>Hey! Who pulled up the rope?</i>

770
2:22:25,468 --> 2:22:29,54
Hey, who pulled up the rope?

771
2:22:31,307 --> 2:22:32,641
Bunch of morons!

772
2:22:47,657 --> 2:22:49,32
Hello there.

773
2:22:49,158 --> 2:22:50,534
<i>Hands up!</i>

774
2:22:50,868 --> 2:22:54,621
How can I put my hands up
when I'm holding on to the rope?

775
2:22:54,747 --> 2:22:55,956
<i>Come out of there!</i>

776
2:23:6,384 --> 2:23:8,218
I'm really innocent this time...

777
2:23:9,387 --> 2:23:11,54
...like a newborn babe.

778
2:23:15,518 --> 2:23:18,61
This may surprise you, Franz...

779
2:23:19,605 --> 2:23:21,22
but I believe you.

780
2:23:24,777 --> 2:23:27,696
Then everything's in order,

781
2:23:27,864 --> 2:23:29,322
and I can go now, right?

782
2:23:29,532 --> 2:23:31,408
Just a moment.

783
2:23:34,203 --> 2:23:35,370
Cigarette?

784
2:23:35,538 --> 2:23:37,38
Uh-oh.

785
2:23:49,260 --> 2:23:51,511
I'll take your word for it, Franz...

786
2:23:52,889 --> 2:23:54,973
provided...

787
2:23:55,892 --> 2:23:59,603
you can tell me...

788
2:24:1,22 --> 2:24:5,150
who the man was
that you were looking for

789
2:24:5,276 --> 2:24:8,236
and that you found in that building.

790
2:24:8,738 --> 2:24:10,405
I don't understand, Inspector.

791
2:24:11,657 --> 2:24:13,783
A man, you say?

792
2:24:15,286 --> 2:24:19,831
I know nothing about that.
There must be some mistake.

793
2:24:20,833 --> 2:24:22,918
I know nothing.

794
2:24:23,44 --> 2:24:24,920
Nothing at all.

795
2:24:25,671 --> 2:24:27,297
Of course.

796
2:24:28,257 --> 2:24:30,91
There's just one thing I don't get:

797
2:24:30,259 --> 2:24:32,52
why you're covering up

798
2:24:32,261 --> 2:24:34,596
for the gang
who left you in the lurch.

799
2:24:36,432 --> 2:24:39,601
Fine friends, running off
when things heat up,

800
2:24:39,727 --> 2:24:41,645
leaving you right in the fire.

801
2:24:42,522 --> 2:24:44,64
Phooey!

802
2:24:46,275 --> 2:24:50,403
That ploy won't work with me,
Inspector.

803
2:25:17,223 --> 2:25:18,723
Listen...

804
2:25:24,438 --> 2:25:26,606
What can happen to me anyway?

805
2:25:27,191 --> 2:25:29,859
<i>Maybe a little property damage...
so what?</i>

806
2:25:30,778 --> 2:25:32,195
<i>Nothing was pinched!</i>

807
2:25:32,321 --> 2:25:34,322
<i>But something was pinched,
my friend!</i>

808
2:25:34,949 --> 2:25:36,157
In fact, a good deal.

809
2:25:36,284 --> 2:25:38,910
What? Something got pinched?

810
2:25:40,788 --> 2:25:42,372
How much?

811
2:25:42,498 --> 2:25:45,917
Tell me what you know
and I'll do the same.

812
2:25:46,377 --> 2:25:49,87
I already told you.
I know nothing.

813
2:25:51,632 --> 2:25:53,133
Very well.

814
2:25:56,387 --> 2:25:58,680
Give it some thought, Franz.

815
2:25:59,807 --> 2:26:6,21
Leave a man alone
for a couple hours...

816
2:26:7,23 --> 2:26:12,68
and a lot comes back to him
that he couldn't remember before.

817
2:26:14,405 --> 2:26:15,864
Take him away.

818
2:26:31,881 --> 2:26:33,715
Send the night watchman in.

819
2:26:37,53 --> 2:26:38,887
Mr. Damowatz.

820
2:26:45,853 --> 2:26:47,354
Please sit down.

821
2:26:49,732 --> 2:26:53,568
Now then, you said
in your statement...

822
2:26:54,362 --> 2:26:58,239
Listen carefully, in case
you have to testify under oath later.

823
2:27:1,577 --> 2:27:6,373
You clearly heard one of the burglars
say to the guy guarding you,

824
2:27:6,832 --> 2:27:10,669
"We got him. I found the guy.
He's in the attic".

825
2:27:10,795 --> 2:27:13,755
Is that correct?
- Yes, Inspector.

826
2:27:15,383 --> 2:27:21,596
Yes, I'll swear to that anytime.

827
2:27:22,765 --> 2:27:23,890
Good.

828
2:27:24,16 --> 2:27:26,518
Go home now
and recover from your ordeal.

829
2:27:26,811 --> 2:27:29,729
But please remain available
for further questioning.

830
2:27:29,897 --> 2:27:32,107
Of course, Inspector.

831
2:27:34,527 --> 2:27:36,194
Good morning, Inspector.

832
2:27:36,320 --> 2:27:37,696
Morning.

833
2:27:51,419 --> 2:27:54,838
Tell me, is Inspector Lohmann
in the building?

834
2:27:56,48 --> 2:27:58,925
He's talking to someone?
No, it doesn't matter.

835
2:27:59,301 --> 2:28:1,803
I'll come over myself.

836
2:28:4,724 --> 2:28:7,58
What? I see.

837
2:28:7,893 --> 2:28:10,311
Hasn't come home yet, eh?

838
2:28:11,564 --> 2:28:14,274
Did you keep an eye
on the old Winkler woman too?

839
2:28:14,525 --> 2:28:15,900
Come in.

840
2:28:16,652 --> 2:28:17,986
Come in!

841
2:28:19,321 --> 2:28:21,614
<i>- Am I disturbing you?
- No, come in.</i>

842
2:28:23,75 --> 2:28:25,827
Listen, the whole block
is surrounded.

843
2:28:26,36 --> 2:28:29,497
If he decides to go home,
he has to run into us.

844
2:28:29,999 --> 2:28:32,208
So just keep on waiting.

845
2:28:33,2 --> 2:28:35,712
If anything happens,
I'll be here at the precinct.

846
2:28:40,134 --> 2:28:41,509
Damn it!

847
2:28:48,142 --> 2:28:49,642
What do you want?

848
2:28:50,60 --> 2:28:52,187
I wanted...

849
2:28:53,606 --> 2:28:55,523
to ask a favor of you.

850
2:28:58,861 --> 2:29:0,695
Dishwater again!

851
2:29:1,30 --> 2:29:3,31
I wanted to ask you...

852
2:29:4,33 --> 2:29:6,701
Read this first.

853
2:29:13,125 --> 2:29:14,876
- A statement?
- Yeah.

854
2:29:15,711 --> 2:29:17,712
An office building was broken into.

855
2:29:25,137 --> 2:29:26,679
Bennostrasse?

856
2:29:27,223 --> 2:29:28,932
<i>That's a respectable part of town.</i>

857
2:29:30,976 --> 2:29:33,144
<i>Perhaps not that respectable after all.</i>

858
2:29:34,855 --> 2:29:36,272
<i>Hell, this is getting serious!</i>

859
2:29:45,324 --> 2:29:47,784
<i>What the... Did they mean to empty
the whole joint?</i>

860
2:29:49,745 --> 2:29:53,39
<i>What could they have been
looking for in the coal?</i>

861
2:29:54,416 --> 2:29:57,43
<i>Incredible! Unbelievable!</i>

862
2:30:0,422 --> 2:30:1,881
<i>I'll be damned!</i>

863
2:30:5,803 --> 2:30:7,595
<i>This is madness!</i>

864
2:30:10,766 --> 2:30:14,143
<i>Ah, so they were after
the savings bank!</i>

865
2:30:15,521 --> 2:30:17,605
<i>Good God!
What could this mean?</i>

866
2:30:19,275 --> 2:30:21,609
<i>I don't understand at all.</i>

867
2:30:21,944 --> 2:30:24,70
<i>They didn't even touch it?</i>

868
2:30:24,280 --> 2:30:27,490
<i>Must've been a bunch of real idiots!</i>

869
2:30:30,35 --> 2:30:32,36
I'll be damned!

870
2:30:32,204 --> 2:30:34,497
Isn't that something?

871
2:30:34,748 --> 2:30:37,750
Nothing stolen,
but a man was carried off.

872
2:30:37,960 --> 2:30:39,878
God knows where they took him.

873
2:30:40,129 --> 2:30:41,796
That's just great.

874
2:30:42,131 --> 2:30:45,49
And Franz isn't talking.

875
2:30:45,175 --> 2:30:46,634
He's afraid, of course.

876
2:30:47,303 --> 2:30:51,848
I know him well. Guy like him would
rather jump out the fifth-floor window

877
2:30:51,974 --> 2:30:53,933
than be mixed up in a murder rap.

878
2:30:55,895 --> 2:31:1,399
What if we could
get at him from that angle?

879
2:31:2,401 --> 2:31:5,987
Lohmann, if you'd be willing
to help me out...

880
2:31:9,408 --> 2:31:11,284
Very clever.

881
2:31:11,785 --> 2:31:13,745
I see the wheels turning.

882
2:31:15,497 --> 2:31:18,458
Let's send for this Franz.

883
2:31:22,588 --> 2:31:24,213
You're wanted for questioning.

884
2:31:25,549 --> 2:31:28,551
What? They sent four guys for me?

885
2:31:28,844 --> 2:31:31,304
What's this about?
- Move it!

886
2:31:54,745 --> 2:31:57,413
"Homicide squad.

887
2:31:58,165 --> 2:32:1,834
Inspector Karl Lohmann".

888
2:32:7,299 --> 2:32:9,425
What do you want with me?

889
2:32:9,843 --> 2:32:12,762
What have I got to do
with the homicide squad?

890
2:32:23,732 --> 2:32:25,566
Yes, young man...

891
2:32:26,652 --> 2:32:28,903
your case has been turned over to me.

892
2:32:32,866 --> 2:32:34,575
But why?

893
2:32:37,287 --> 2:32:38,538
Why?

894
2:32:40,416 --> 2:32:44,252
You boys did your work
a little too well.

895
2:32:50,926 --> 2:32:52,802
<i>One of the watchmen...</i>

896
2:33:2,438 --> 2:33:3,521
Dead?

897
2:33:8,777 --> 2:33:10,695
Accessory to murder.

898
2:33:12,406 --> 2:33:13,906
Nasty business.

899
2:33:14,33 --> 2:33:17,76
Inspector, I've had enough!

900
2:33:17,202 --> 2:33:19,245
I want no part of this!

901
2:33:19,371 --> 2:33:22,206
I'll tell you everything I know!

902
2:33:23,250 --> 2:33:25,626
Very sensible,
but, unfortunately, too late.

903
2:33:25,836 --> 2:33:28,504
It can't be too late!

904
2:33:28,630 --> 2:33:31,7
It can't be!

905
2:33:31,550 --> 2:33:33,676
I'll tell you everything!

906
2:33:34,470 --> 2:33:37,889
Even what we were looking for
in that damn building.

907
2:33:38,140 --> 2:33:39,515
Well...

908
2:33:40,809 --> 2:33:42,602
The child murderer!

909
2:33:53,238 --> 2:33:54,530
What?

910
2:33:55,449 --> 2:33:56,741
Who?

911
2:33:57,159 --> 2:33:59,368
The child murderer, Inspector.

912
2:34:5,667 --> 2:34:7,335
Just a moment.

913
2:34:25,479 --> 2:34:27,939
This had to happen to me!

914
2:34:31,401 --> 2:34:34,153
Me, of all people.

915
2:34:41,703 --> 2:34:43,579
Come sit down, my boy.

916
2:34:47,793 --> 2:34:51,921
We're gonna level
with each other, got it?

917
2:34:52,464 --> 2:34:53,714
Certainly, Inspector.

918
2:34:53,924 --> 2:34:56,676
And God help you
if you pull something.

919
2:34:57,719 --> 2:34:59,220
Now then...

920
2:34:59,471 --> 2:35:1,889
what have you boys got to do
with the murderer,

921
2:35:2,307 --> 2:35:4,934
and where was the guy taken?

922
2:35:7,396 --> 2:35:10,314
Well, Inspector...

923
2:35:11,733 --> 2:35:16,70
you know the old
Kuntz & Levy distillery?

924
2:35:16,655 --> 2:35:19,407
<i>The one that went belly-up
in the Depression?</i>

925
2:35:19,533 --> 2:35:21,951
<i>That's the one.</i>

926
2:35:22,77 --> 2:35:25,371
<i>Since then, the building's stood empty,
and no one gives a damn about it.</i>

927
2:35:45,601 --> 2:35:47,935
Get out here! Move it!

928
2:35:50,772 --> 2:35:52,607
Let me go!

929
2:36:1,450 --> 2:36:3,451
What have I done to you?

930
2:36:3,577 --> 2:36:4,660
You swine!

931
2:36:4,786 --> 2:36:8,80
Let go of me!

932
2:36:10,459 --> 2:36:13,211
Bastards!

933
2:36:14,4 --> 2:36:16,714
Swine!
What do you want from me?

934
2:36:17,49 --> 2:36:18,799
What do you want...

935
2:36:48,830 --> 2:36:50,81
Help!

936
2:36:50,207 --> 2:36:54,126
Help! Let me out of here!

937
2:36:54,503 --> 2:36:56,671
I want out!

938
2:36:56,880 --> 2:36:58,923
Let me out of here!

939
2:36:59,49 --> 2:37:2,9
You'll never get out of here.

940
2:37:3,262 --> 2:37:5,680
Gentlemen, I beg of you!

941
2:37:6,98 --> 2:37:9,16
I don't even know
what you want with me.

942
2:37:9,268 --> 2:37:11,477
I beg you, let me go.

943
2:37:11,687 --> 2:37:15,22
This whole thing must be a mistake!

944
2:37:16,233 --> 2:37:17,692
A mis...

945
2:37:19,653 --> 2:37:21,237
No.

946
2:37:21,822 --> 2:37:24,615
No mistake.
Out of the question.

947
2:37:25,242 --> 2:37:27,493
This is no mistake.

948
2:37:33,208 --> 2:37:34,875
No.

949
2:37:35,585 --> 2:37:37,336
No mistake.

950
2:37:41,466 --> 2:37:43,134
You recognize this?

951
2:37:43,385 --> 2:37:48,97
You bought a balloon just like this
for little Elsie Beckmann.

952
2:37:48,223 --> 2:37:49,932
Just like this one.

953
2:37:55,647 --> 2:37:57,565
No!

954
2:37:58,734 --> 2:38:1,819
Where did you bury
little Marga Perl, you bastard?

955
2:38:6,742 --> 2:38:8,784
But I never...

956
2:38:9,619 --> 2:38:11,912
I never even met her!

957
2:38:14,750 --> 2:38:16,751
You never even met her!

958
2:38:19,254 --> 2:38:21,464
I suppose you never
met her either, huh?

959
2:38:23,342 --> 2:38:24,550
Or her?

960
2:38:27,429 --> 2:38:29,263
You never met her either, huh?

961
2:38:30,265 --> 2:38:31,932
- Stop him!
- Grab him!

962
2:38:32,59 --> 2:38:34,101
- Stop him!
- Don't let him escape!

963
2:38:34,269 --> 2:38:36,20
Watch out! The door!

964
2:38:36,938 --> 2:38:39,440
- Let me out!
- Punch him in the face!

965
2:38:39,608 --> 2:38:42,360
Let go of me!

966
2:39:4,383 --> 2:39:8,135
- You have no right to treat me this way!
- We'll show you we do!

967
2:39:8,345 --> 2:39:10,930
You have no right to hold me here!

968
2:39:11,139 --> 2:39:14,600
Right? There's only one thing
right for a man like you... death!

969
2:39:14,810 --> 2:39:16,852
- Right! Kill him!
- Kill the rabid dog!

970
2:39:16,978 --> 2:39:18,854
- Ice him!
- Let him have it!

971
2:39:19,106 --> 2:39:20,606
Quiet!

972
2:39:20,816 --> 2:39:22,483
Kill him!

973
2:39:31,868 --> 2:39:34,495
You spoke of "right" just now.

974
2:39:35,664 --> 2:39:37,790
We will be your right.

975
2:39:39,167 --> 2:39:42,670
Everyone sitting here
is an expert in the rule of law!

976
2:39:45,632 --> 2:39:47,883
From six weeks in Tegel prison...

977
2:39:48,301 --> 2:39:50,845
to 15 years in Brandenburg.

978
2:39:54,141 --> 2:39:57,309
They'll make sure
you get your rights.

979
2:39:58,520 --> 2:40:0,479
You'll even have defense counsel.

980
2:40:1,773 --> 2:40:3,899
Everything according
to the letter of the law.

981
2:40:4,359 --> 2:40:6,193
Defense counsel?

982
2:40:6,361 --> 2:40:9,321
I need no defense counsel!
Who's gonna prosecute me?

983
2:40:9,614 --> 2:40:11,407
You, perhaps?

984
2:40:14,35 --> 2:40:14,910
Hey, you.

985
2:40:15,162 --> 2:40:19,206
If I were you,
I wouldn't make big speeches.

986
2:40:19,374 --> 2:40:23,169
Your head's at stake here,
in case you hadn't noticed.

987
2:40:24,87 --> 2:40:26,464
And just who are you?

988
2:40:28,550 --> 2:40:33,596
I have the dubious pleasure
of serving as your defense.

989
2:40:34,514 --> 2:40:36,932
Though I'm afraid
it won't do you much good.

990
2:40:38,977 --> 2:40:43,147
Do you all want to kill me?
You want to just wipe me out?

991
2:40:43,732 --> 2:40:47,359
We simply want to put you
out of commission.

992
2:40:48,361 --> 2:40:50,779
And we'll only be sure
of that when you're dead.

993
2:40:50,906 --> 2:40:53,949
But you can't murder me
just like that!

994
2:40:56,661 --> 2:41:0,247
I demand to be handed over
to the police!

995
2:41:3,585 --> 2:41:8,380
I demand to be brought
before a real court of law!

996
2:41:9,633 --> 2:41:11,383
That's a good one!

997
2:41:11,510 --> 2:41:14,53
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?
- Look who's talking!

998
2:41:14,262 --> 2:41:17,223
So you can plead insanity

999
2:41:17,390 --> 2:41:20,518
and spend the rest of your life
being cared for by the state.

1000
2:41:20,727 --> 2:41:24,480
And then you break out of the asylum
or receive a pardon,

1001
2:41:24,856 --> 2:41:28,234
and you're happy as can be,
free to kill with impunity,

1002
2:41:28,777 --> 2:41:32,321
protected by law
on grounds of insanity...

1003
2:41:32,697 --> 2:41:36,659
and you're back to chasing little children!
No, no more of that!

1004
2:41:37,202 --> 2:41:39,787
You must be taken out of action!
You must go!

1005
2:41:40,789 --> 2:41:43,707
But I can't help it!

1006
2:41:48,964 --> 2:41:50,297
I can't...

1007
2:41:50,632 --> 2:41:55,844
I really can't... help it!

1008
2:41:58,265 --> 2:41:59,682
We know that one!

1009
2:42:0,308 --> 2:42:2,643
Before the judge,
we all "can't help it".

1010
2:42:9,526 --> 2:42:11,402
What would you know?

1011
2:42:11,695 --> 2:42:13,696
What are you talking about?

1012
2:42:14,114 --> 2:42:16,448
Who are you anyway?

1013
2:42:17,325 --> 2:42:18,867
Who are you?

1014
2:42:19,286 --> 2:42:21,245
All of you.

1015
2:42:21,580 --> 2:42:23,247
Criminals.

1016
2:42:24,374 --> 2:42:27,84
Probably proud of it, too...

1017
2:42:27,419 --> 2:42:29,503
proud you can crack a safe

1018
2:42:29,671 --> 2:42:32,631
or sneak into houses
or cheat at cards.

1019
2:42:32,882 --> 2:42:36,844
All of which it seems to me
you could just as easily give up

1020
2:42:37,220 --> 2:42:39,597
if you had learned something useful,

1021
2:42:39,723 --> 2:42:41,682
or if you had jobs

1022
2:42:41,891 --> 2:42:44,435
or if you weren't such lazy pigs.

1023
2:42:45,895 --> 2:42:47,521
But me?

1024
2:42:47,856 --> 2:42:50,858
Can I do anything about it?

1025
2:42:52,27 --> 2:42:56,30
Don't I have
this cursed thing inside me?

1026
2:42:57,32 --> 2:43:0,200
This fire, this voice, this agony?

1027
2:43:3,997 --> 2:43:6,373
So you mean to say...

1028
2:43:7,250 --> 2:43:9,293
<i>you have to kill?</i>

1029
2:43:14,90 --> 2:43:17,301
I have to roam the streets endlessly,

1030
2:43:17,927 --> 2:43:19,970
always sensing

1031
2:43:20,430 --> 2:43:23,140
that someone's following me.

1032
2:43:23,266 --> 2:43:24,892
It's me!

1033
2:43:25,268 --> 2:43:27,227
I'm shadowing myself!

1034
2:43:28,563 --> 2:43:30,397
Silently...

1035
2:43:30,899 --> 2:43:32,900
but I still hear it!

1036
2:43:33,318 --> 2:43:37,655
Yes, sometimes I feel

1037
2:43:37,781 --> 2:43:39,782
like I'm tracking myself down.

1038
2:43:40,492 --> 2:43:43,577
I want to run...
run away from myself!

1039
2:43:43,995 --> 2:43:46,413
But I can't!
I can't escape from myself!

1040
2:43:47,248 --> 2:43:50,417
I must take the path
that it's driving me down

1041
2:43:50,585 --> 2:43:55,339
and run and run
down endless streets!

1042
2:43:55,590 --> 2:43:57,675
I want off!

1043
2:43:59,427 --> 2:44:2,721
And with me run the ghosts

1044
2:44:3,98 --> 2:44:6,517
of the mothers and children.

1045
2:44:6,643 --> 2:44:10,396
They never go away.
They're always there!

1046
2:44:10,605 --> 2:44:12,106
Always!

1047
2:44:12,232 --> 2:44:13,941
Always!

1048
2:44:15,110 --> 2:44:16,694
Except...

1049
2:44:17,278 --> 2:44:19,279
when I'm doing it...

1050
2:44:20,156 --> 2:44:22,533
when I...

1051
2:44:29,708 --> 2:44:32,334
Then I don't remember a thing.

1052
2:44:33,294 --> 2:44:37,715
Then I'm standing before a poster,

1053
2:44:37,841 --> 2:44:40,384
reading what I've done.

1054
2:44:40,635 --> 2:44:42,678
I read and read...

1055
2:44:43,430 --> 2:44:45,347
<i>I did that?</i>

1056
2:44:45,974 --> 2:44:48,100
I don't remember a thing!

1057
2:44:49,227 --> 2:44:51,145
But who will believe me?

1058
2:44:51,312 --> 2:44:54,314
Who knows what it's like inside me?

1059
2:44:54,441 --> 2:44:59,319
How it screams and cries out
inside me when I have to do it!

1060
2:44:59,988 --> 2:45:1,655
Don't want to! Must!

1061
2:45:1,990 --> 2:45:4,283
Don't want to! Must!

1062
2:45:4,993 --> 2:45:7,953
And then a voice cries out,

1063
2:45:8,79 --> 2:45:10,497
and I can't listen anymore!

1064
2:45:10,790 --> 2:45:13,709
Help! I can't!

1065
2:45:14,2 --> 2:45:17,337
I can't!

1066
2:45:22,719 --> 2:45:24,928
The accused has stated

1067
2:45:25,346 --> 2:45:27,431
that he can't help himself.

1068
2:45:27,932 --> 2:45:31,727
<i>In other words,
he must commit murder.</i>

1069
2:45:33,897 --> 2:45:36,690
With that he has pronounced
his own death sentence.

1070
2:45:36,858 --> 2:45:38,192
Right!

1071
2:45:38,359 --> 2:45:40,652
A man who claims

1072
2:45:41,446 --> 2:45:44,740
that he's compelled
to destroy the lives of others...

1073
2:45:45,200 --> 2:45:48,952
such a man must be
extinguished like a bonfire!

1074
2:45:49,120 --> 2:45:51,163
Such a man must be obliterated!

1075
2:45:51,331 --> 2:45:52,873
Wiped out!

1076
2:46:2,50 --> 2:46:4,259
May I address the court?

1077
2:46:4,636 --> 2:46:6,678
Counsel for the defense
has the floor.

1078
2:46:9,98 --> 2:46:13,60
My learned colleague
who just spoke...

1079
2:46:14,395 --> 2:46:16,730
who is, if I'm not mistaken,

1080
2:46:16,981 --> 2:46:19,858
wanted by the police
on three counts of manslaughter...

1081
2:46:19,984 --> 2:46:22,194
That's irrelevant here.

1082
2:46:22,403 --> 2:46:23,904
has claimed

1083
2:46:24,197 --> 2:46:27,324
that the fact that my client
was acting compulsively

1084
2:46:27,450 --> 2:46:29,243
warrants the death sentence.

1085
2:46:29,494 --> 2:46:31,328
That's right!

1086
2:46:31,913 --> 2:46:33,288
He is mistaken,

1087
2:46:33,623 --> 2:46:37,584
because the very nature of compulsion
warrants an acquittal!

1088
2:46:37,752 --> 2:46:39,294
Get outta here, will ya?

1089
2:46:40,213 --> 2:46:41,463
Are you nuts, or plastered?

1090
2:46:41,589 --> 2:46:43,382
It is precisely
the nature of compulsion

1091
2:46:43,508 --> 2:46:47,94
that relieves him
of responsibility for his actions!

1092
2:46:47,512 --> 2:46:51,56
And a man cannot be punished for that

1093
2:46:51,182 --> 2:46:52,641
for which he is not responsible!

1094
2:46:52,767 --> 2:46:57,312
- Ridiculous!
- You mean this monster should go free?

1095
2:46:57,438 --> 2:46:59,106
That he should live?

1096
2:46:59,232 --> 2:47:2,609
I'm saying that this man is sick,

1097
2:47:2,735 --> 2:47:6,697
and you turn a sick man
over to a doctor, not an executioner.

1098
2:47:6,823 --> 2:47:10,951
- Will you guarantee his cure?
- What does the state build asylums for?

1099
2:47:11,119 --> 2:47:14,955
- What if he breaks out?
- Or he's declared cured and released?

1100
2:47:15,81 --> 2:47:17,499
And one fine day
the killing starts all over?

1101
2:47:18,167 --> 2:47:19,960
Another month-long manhunt!

1102
2:47:20,86 --> 2:47:22,45
Once again the insanity clause,
once again the asylum!

1103
2:47:22,171 --> 2:47:25,632
Another breakout or possible release!
And again... "must kill"!

1104
2:47:26,342 --> 2:47:29,219
Is this supposed
to go on indefinitely?

1105
2:47:29,387 --> 2:47:34,725
No one has the right to kill a man

1106
2:47:34,851 --> 2:47:36,852
who cannot be held
responsible for his crimes!

1107
2:47:37,103 --> 2:47:38,687
Not even the state,

1108
2:47:38,980 --> 2:47:41,773
and all of you least of all!

1109
2:47:42,734 --> 2:47:47,613
The state must ensure
that this man is rendered harmless

1110
2:47:47,947 --> 2:47:52,492
so that he ceases to be
a danger to society!

1111
2:47:56,205 --> 2:47:58,498
You never had kids, did ya?

1112
2:47:58,625 --> 2:48:0,709
Then you never lost any either.

1113
2:48:2,337 --> 2:48:4,880
But if you wanna know what it's like

1114
2:48:5,6 --> 2:48:8,8
when a little child is taken from you,

1115
2:48:8,134 --> 2:48:11,428
just ask the parents
whose kids he took away!

1116
2:48:12,180 --> 2:48:17,225
Ask 'em about the days and nights
not knowing what had happened,

1117
2:48:17,977 --> 2:48:20,646
and later,
when they finally found out...

1118
2:48:22,315 --> 2:48:24,775
Why don't you ask the mothers?

1119
2:48:24,943 --> 2:48:27,235
You should ask the mothers!

1120
2:48:27,528 --> 2:48:29,571
Think you'd get mercy
from any of them

1121
2:48:29,697 --> 2:48:31,865
for murdering their kids?

1122
2:48:32,33 --> 2:48:33,742
- The woman's right!
- Absolutely!

1123
2:48:33,868 --> 2:48:35,869
No mercy for the killer!

1124
2:48:35,995 --> 2:48:37,704
- Let him have it!
- Slaughter the bastard!

1125
2:48:37,830 --> 2:48:40,707
- Kill the monster!
- Kill him!

1126
2:48:40,875 --> 2:48:42,876
- Put the animal to death!
- Rub him out!

1127
2:48:43,44 --> 2:48:44,920
- Kill him!
- Waste him!

1128
2:48:45,46 --> 2:48:48,882
- Get rid of him!
- Annihilate the monster!

1129
2:48:50,51 --> 2:48:53,387
I will not let you shout me down!

1130
2:48:56,975 --> 2:49:3,563
I will not allow a murder
to be committed in my presence.

1131
2:49:3,898 --> 2:49:6,817
I demand that this human being...

1132
2:49:7,68 --> 2:49:8,360
That's not a human being!

1133
2:49:8,486 --> 2:49:11,780
that this human being be afforded
the same protection under the law

1134
2:49:12,31 --> 2:49:13,699
rendered the common criminal!

1135
2:49:13,908 --> 2:49:15,409
Not a chance!

1136
2:49:15,576 --> 2:49:19,79
I demand that he be
handed over to the police!

1137
2:49:19,205 --> 2:49:22,416
The police!
Of all the dumb...

1138
2:49:49,444 --> 2:49:51,278
In the name of the law...

1139
2:50:14,969 --> 2:50:16,636
In the name of the people...

1140
2:50:16,804 --> 2:50:21,391
This will not bring
our children back.

1141
2:50:26,439 --> 2:50:28,398
One has to...

1142
2:50:29,67 --> 2:50:30,901
keep closer watch...

1143
2:50:32,320 --> 2:50:34,988
over the children!

1144
2:50:36,991 --> 2:50:38,492
<i>All of you!</i>

1145
