<i>Just you wait, it won't be long</i>

00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:07,274
The man in black will soon be here

4
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:12,237
With his cleaver's blade so true

5
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:16,533
He'll make mincemeat out of you!

6
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:18,243
You're out.

7
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:42,893
I told you to stop singing
that awful song!

8
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:45,646
Didn't you hear me?

9
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:51,276
That same cursed song over and over!

10
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:17,886
Dear me, that's heavy.

11
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,325
What's the matter?

12
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:44,454
I told those kids to stop
singing that awful song,

13
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:47,082
but they sing it all day long.

14
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,585
As if we haven't heard
enough of that murderer already.

15
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:51,336
Ah, leave 'em alone.

16
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,797
As long as we can hear 'em singing,

17
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:56,258
at least we know
they're still there.

18
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:59,636
Yes, I guess you're right.

10,000 MARKS' REWARD -
WHO IS THE MURDERER?

21
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:40,696
"Little Kurt Klawitzky and his sister Klara
have been missing since June 11th.

22
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:43,699
Evidence leads us to believe
the children were victims of a crime

23
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,244
similar to that committed
last fall against the Doering siblings".

24
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:56,295
What a pretty ball you have there.

25
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:01,341
What's your name?

26
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,594
Elsie Beckmann.

27
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,624
Didn't Elsie come with you?

28
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:38,211
No, she didn't.

29
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,276
Pretty!

Thank you.

31
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:25,133
A thrilling new chapter, Mrs. Beckmann.
Passionate and moving.

32
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,887
Just a moment, Mr. Gehrke.

33
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,308
Tell me, Mr. Gehrke.

34
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:36,353
Have you seen little Elsie?

35
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:39,606
No. Didn't she just
come up the stairs?

36
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:42,818
No, she's not home yet.

37
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:45,695
She won't be long now.
Good-bye.

38
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:48,490

<i>who has already claimed eight victims

59
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:12,611
<i>We must emphasize once again</i>

60
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:16,031
that it is, now more than ever,
every mother and father's sacred duty

61
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:20,535
to alert their children
to this ever present danger

62
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:26,541
and to the friendly guise
it is likely to assume.

63
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:30,003
A little candy, a toy, or an apple

64
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:34,549
can suffice to lure a child
to his or her doom".

65
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,885
Very true!

66
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:40,096
Keep reading.

67
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,434
"Anxiety among the general public
is heightened

68
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:50,440
by the police's failure
to apprehend a suspect.

69
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:54,402
But the police are faced
with the almost impossible task

70
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:59,074
of catching a criminal who left
not the slightest clue behind.

71
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,576
Who is the murderer?'

72
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:03,244
What does he look like?

73
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,747
Where is he hiding?

74
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:09,334
No one knows him,
yet he is among us.

75
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:12,921
Anybody sitting next to you
could be the murderer".

76
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,426
Yes, that's very true.

77
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:22,097
- Why look at me when you say that?
- You know very well.

78
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,641
What do I know very well?

79
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:28,603
Think about it.
It'll come to you.

80
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,439
What are you saying?

81
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:36,820
I saw you follow that little girl
from the fourth floor up the stairs.

00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:39,155
You're crazy, you dirty swine!

83
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:42,450

Me, or a man who chases little girls?

I'll have you locked up!

00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:02,971
Slanderer!
Trying to ruin my reputation!

90
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:06,349
<i>Damn slanderer!
Besmirching a man's good name!</i>

91
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,601
<i>And the police fall for it!</i>

92
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:10,478
<i>A search warrant!</i>

93
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,106
How awful! What a disgrace!

94
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,442
Searching a man's house
based on an anonymous letter!

95
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:20,488
Mr. Jäger, please calm down.
We're only doing our job.

96
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:24,659
As if it weren't enough
that we're in constant fear for our kids!

97
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:28,997
You see? That's why the police
must follow up every lead.

98
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:32,208
Any man on the street
could be the murderer.

99
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,838
Can you please tell me
what time it is?

100
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,506
Yes, my child.

101
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:49,184
Now you must hurry home.
Where do you live?

102
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:52,228
What's it to you
where the kid lives?

103
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:55,815
Excuse me?

104
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,692
What do you want with that kid?

105
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:01,362
Absolutely nothing!

106
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,782
What do you want with me?

107
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,658
I'll show you what I want!

108
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:09,370
Let me go!
This is an outrage!

109
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,539
- What's going on?
- This is an outrage!

110
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:14,459
- What does Four-Eyes want?
- Don't get so excited.

111
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:17,670
First chatting up children...
- Punch him in the face!

112
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,297
then acting like a big shot!

113
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:23,384
Will you let me go!
I didn't even speak to the child!

114
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:26,429
- Get her alone, eh?
- And kill her like the others, right?

115
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,682
- He's the murderer!
- Hold him!

116
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,142
Call the police!

117
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:35,480
- Never around when you need 'em!
- Officer!

118
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:41,611
Make way, gentlemen.
Let us through.

119
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:46,407
Sure, you can catch pickpockets!
Why don't you catch the murderer instead!

120
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,701
What? Is he the murderer?

121
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:51,955
Break it up!
Come on, move along!

122
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:54,374
- The murderer!
- The monster!

123
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:57,252
Get him!

124
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,922
Tackle him!

But I'm not done yet!"

131
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:28,992
This is a terrible scandal!

132
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:33,872
Imagine the effect such a note
will have on the public, Commissioner!

133
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:37,292
This is simply irresponsible!

134
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:42,463
Mr. Secretary, we cannot stop the murderer
from writing to whomever he wishes!

135
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:47,802
This severely pathological man
probably takes great pleasure

136
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:51,347
in seeing his crimes
covered in the press.

137
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:55,101
We immediately got in touch
with the newspaper

138
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,604
and had them send us
the original letter.

139
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,981
The lab's working on it right now.

140
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:05,737
<i>Of course, you can't get good
fingerprints from a postcard</i>

141
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:08,573
<i>that's passed
through so many hands.</i>

142
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:11,367
<i>Nevertheless,
we will leave no stone unturned.</i>

143
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:14,621
<i>We'll painstakingly compare
the results against our archives</i>

144
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:19,918
<i>in hopes of finding something
that can be used to solve this case.</i>

145
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,670
<i>Then we'll send the letter
to our graphologist.</i>

146
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:28,551
"The aforementioned diamond-shaped
and swelling sweeps,

147
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:35,308
clearly seen in the word 'soon',
third line from the bottom..."

148
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,393
You got that?
- Yes.

149
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:44,025
"...attest to the strongly pathological
sexuality of this sex offender.

150
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,526
Period.

151
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:52,700
The partially disrupted and uneven style
of his other letters

152
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:56,120
is, in its interpretation,

153
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:59,707
<i>a form of acting</i>

154
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:06,381
<i>which may manifest externally
as indolence or even lethargy.</i>

155
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:11,427
<i>The writing as a whole displays</i>

156
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:17,558
<i>elusive yet unmistakable signs</i>

157
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,728
<i>of madness".</i>

158
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:25,733
Yes, of course, Commissioner.

159
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:30,238
I have no doubt you're doing your job,
and your men as well.

160
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,740
But we need results!

161
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,575
Results!

162
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:41,958
Mr. Secretary, my men haven't gotten
12 hours' sleep in an entire week!

163
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:46,295
<i>My riot squads
don't get a moment's peace.</i>

164
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:51,634
<i>They report for duty almost more fatigued
than when they were dismissed,</i>

165
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:56,431
<i>because the painstaking nature
of their work wears on the nerves,</i>

166
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:01,352
<i>and 80% - if not 90% -
of our leads are false.</i>

167
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,772
<i>The homicide squad doesn't even
get time to change clothes.</i>

168
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:09,277
<i>They're constantly on call,
always tense and alert,</i>

169
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:11,904
<i>ever ready to spring into action,</i>

170
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,907
<i>to follow even the slightest lead,</i>

171
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:17,785
<i>as it just might be
the one that solves the case.</i>

172
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:21,622
<i>Mr. Secretary, just consider
the search of the crime scene.</i>

173
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,251
<i>To give you an example:</i>

174
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:30,214
<i>In the bushes
just behind a picket fence,</i>

175
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:36,679
<i>a small, white, crumpled
paper wrapping was found.</i>

176
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:40,475
<i>It apparently once contained
inexpensive sweets.</i>

177
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:43,519
<i>In the outermost corner</i>

178
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:46,647
<i>were found traces of fruit drops</i>

179
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,984
<i>and particles of powdered sugar.</i>

180
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:53,321
<i>We've tried to trace the origin
of this wrapper</i>

181
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:58,951
<i>in every candy shop and grocery store
within a radius of a mile and a half,</i>

182
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,454
<i>but all to no avail.</i>

183
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:05,666
<i>With each passing day
we expand the area searched.</i>

184
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:12,924
<i>But, of course,
after such a long time,</i>

185
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:17,178
<i>no one remembers anything
that could serve as a lead.</i>

186
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:21,516
<i>Despite all these setbacks,</i>

187
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:26,229
<i>we're forced to press on
in our investigation,</i>

188
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:27,980
<i>always in uncertainty,</i>

189
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:31,192
<i>and with little chance of success</i>

190
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:35,279
<i>in bringing the case
even one step closer to its conclusion.</i>

191
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:36,697
<i>Our men are doing everyth...</i>

192
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:39,242
What good is all this?

193
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:42,578
Commissioner,
I'm aware you're not dawdling,

194
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:46,582
but that doesn't change the fact
that an unknown killer

195
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:50,545
is terrorizing 4 1/2 million people!

196
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,630
And the police are getting nowhere!

197
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:58,261
Mr. Secretary, you don't seem
to have a clear picture

198
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:03,057
of the enormous obstacles
confronting our forces.

199
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:05,393
Do you realize, for example,

200
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:09,939
regarding the route
the child took home,

201
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:15,486
that there are 15 conflicting
eyewitness accounts alone?

202
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:18,197
Let me give you a random example:

203
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:22,326
"Testimony 1,478
in the Beckmann murder case..."

204
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,495
- You've got no clue.
- More than you, mister!

205
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:27,206
Gentlemen!

206
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:31,377
You must at least know the color
of the cap the little girl wore

207
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:34,255
whom you say you saw
with the stranger!

208
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:36,257
Of course, Inspector.
It was red!

209
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:39,385
- It was green!
- Red!

210
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:46,434
Stop! This is pointless!

211
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,854
Thank you, gentlemen.
- You're welcome!

212
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:51,939
Next witness.

213
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:55,651
If you rely
on a color-blind man for clues,

214
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:58,154
don't be surprised
if you get nowhere!

215
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,115
In their hunt
for this unknown killer,

216
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:05,786
the police have tracked down
more than 1,500 detailed leads.

217
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:10,082
The files in this case
fill 60 thick volumes.

218
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:12,126
We've dispatched all our forces

219
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,921
<i>to systematically comb
the area adjoining the city.</i>

220
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:18,633
<i>Every piece of undergrowth is scoured,
every thicket searched,</i>

221
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,551
<i>every bush examined,</i>

222
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:23,971
<i>since any bush or hollow
could harbor some object</i>

223
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:26,432
<i>that could finally set us
on the right track.</i>

224
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,227
<i>We called in police dogs.</i>

225
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:32,104
<i>We set the best trackers
on the faintest of traces,</i>

226
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,773
<i>but they lost the scent</i>

227
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,150
<i>and failed to pick it up again
despite all efforts.</i>

228
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:38,236
<i>Since the first murders,</i>

229
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:42,031
<i>the police have searched
homeless shelters night after night,</i>

230
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:44,992
<i>subjecting everyone in them
to thorough scrutiny.</i>

231
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:48,746
<i>This does not, of course,
make the police very popular,</i>

232
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:51,165
<i>nor does it reduce
the general public's anxiety.</i>

233
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:56,295
<i>Railway stations are kept
under surveillance around the clock.</i>

234
00:20:56,505 --> 00:21:00,508
<i>Still, the investigation has not yet
yielded the slightest results,</i>

235
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:04,720
<i>nor have nightly raids
in the criminal districts.</i>

236
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,105
The cops!

237
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,622
<i>Get back!</i>

238
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:57,750
<i>Back!
- This is the police!</i>

239
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,677
<i>Let me go, you dirty bastard!</i>

240
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:11,722
<i>Let me go, you son of a bitch!</i>

241
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:15,309
Goddamn bastard!

242
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,854
Put me down!

243
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:20,981
Let me go!

244
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:22,983
Let her go, you filthy pig!

245
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,905
Quiet!

246
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:29,281
Move back!

247
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,409
The top fuzz!

248
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,412
Quiet!

249
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,497
Police orders:

250
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:39,834
Nobody is to leave this establishment.
Get your papers ready.

251
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:51,011
Please!

252
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:57,643
Come now, children,
stop this foolishness.

253
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:00,688
Well, if it isn't Tubby Lohmann!

254
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,660
Quiet!

255
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:17,746
That'll get you nowhere.

256
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:20,708
- Go after the murderer instead!
- Right!

257
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:26,046
Quiet!

258
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:30,551
Be reasonable now!
Step back!

259
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,220
You hear me? Step back!

260
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:36,891
Let's go!
Come on, let's see those papers!

261
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:39,977
<i>- I haven't got any.
- Let's see your papers.</i>

262
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:42,396
<i>Please let me go, Inspector!</i>

263
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:45,566
<i>The two guys who tried to escape
were caught on the Krangasse.</i>

264
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,902
<i>- Leave those chairs alone!
- Shut up!</i>

265
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:49,445
<i>Have your papers ready!</i>

266
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:51,113
<i>Haven't we met before?
- Yeah. So?</i>

267
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,824
<i>Off to the precinct again!</i>

268
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:56,202
<i>Haven't even made a buck tonight!</i>

269
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:01,916
<i>Anyone without papers
goes down to the precinct!</i>

270
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:06,086
<i>I tell you, I'm innocent, really!</i>

271
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:07,463
<i>Stop talking nonsense!</i>

272
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:09,423
<i>- Let's get moving!
- Kiss my ass!</i>

273
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:12,676
<i>- Show your papers!
- Where's the paddy wagon?</i>

274
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:14,470
<i>Don't push.</i>

275
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:16,597
<i>Everyone will get their turn.</i>

276
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,974
<i>- Silence!
- Cool it, kids!</i>

277
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,392
<i>Have your papers ready!</i>

278
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:22,645
Your papers.

279
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:25,856
Inspector, I can't carry my birth
certificate around with me everywhere!

280
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:28,609
- Quit your bellyaching, child.
- I really can't, Inspector!

281
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:30,236
The precinct for you!

282
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:32,112
You make me puke!

283
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:23,664
Shoddy work, my friend.

284
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,333
You've been had.

285
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:29,503
Precinct.
- See you, Willy. Ta-ta!

286
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:32,089
Ah, lay off!

287
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:33,382
Next.

288
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:37,344
Stuck-up snob.

289
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:56,030
What's wrong?

290
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:59,199
- Papa Lohmann...
- ...nabbed him!

291
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:05,706
UNSOLVED BURGLARY AT FURRIER'S

292
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:11,253
We'd better take you
down to the precinct too.

293
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:15,215
What do you mean?
My papers are in order.

294
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:16,425
Move on.

295
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:17,676
Move on!

296
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:19,011
Ah, tough luck!

297
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,512
Next.

298
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:25,934
Papers.
- Don't got none.

299
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,394
To the precinct.

300
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:29,271
Just my luck.

301
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:31,273
Next, come on.

302
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:47,141
You're ruining my business, Sarge.

303
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,226
These raids every night.

304
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:52,813
No one can get a moment's peace!
They're human beings too.

305
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:54,773
You think...

306
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:59,153
we stay up all night
just for the hell of it?

307
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,404
No.

308
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,322
But you're drivin' away my clientele,

309
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:05,242
and you won't find the guy
you're lookin' for here anyway.

310
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:10,330
If you knew how steamed they are

311
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,583
at the guy who's causing these raids.

312
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:14,543
Especially the girls.

313
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:17,379
Sure, they solicit.
Business is business.

314
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:20,716
But believe me,

315
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:24,136
in every one of them
beats a mother's heart!

316
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:26,513
I know a lot of toughs

317
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:30,476
who get all teary-eyed
just seein' the little ones at play.

318
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:35,022
If they ever get their hands
on that monster,

319
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:37,024
they'll make toothpicks out of him!

320
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,485
Ready to leave, Sergeant.

321
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:40,986
So long.

322
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:53,999
They hit the Crocodile Club today.

323
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,877
Two paddy wagons.

324
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:05,052
What's keeping Safecracker?

325
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:10,224
Is it 3:00 yet?

326
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:12,100
I'll find out.

327
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,733
The exact time, please, miss.

328
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:23,278
2:58. Thank you.

329
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:44,758
2:58.

330
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:16,498
The cops are crawling
the streets like ants again.

331
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:20,043
Green coats wherever you spit.

332
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:22,671
They're on your back
even if you're with a broad.

333
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:25,716
They've gone nuts...
got this murderer on the brain.

334
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:30,178
My old lady has a little six-year-old girl,
and every night I have to check

335
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:34,099
under the bed to see
if the murderer's hiding there.

336
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:38,061
You can't do business anymore
for tripping over cops everywhere.

337
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:42,149
There's no privacy anymore.
I'm fed up with it.

338
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:44,943
What else is new?

339
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:54,119
- Where the heck is Safecracker?
- Think they might have nabbed him?

340
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,830
That guy? Come on.

341
00:31:56,998 --> 00:32:02,169
Scotland Yard laid a trap for him once
on a bank job he pulled in London.

342
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:05,839
There he was, hands up,
back to the wall,

343
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:09,259
cops all around him.

344
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:12,346
Seconds later there were
three men dead on the ground,

345
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:14,431
but he wasn't one of 'em!

346
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:17,142
No one better
from Berlin to San Francisco.

347
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:20,812
They've been after him six years
and they've yet to get him.

348
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:23,565
Not yet. But put enough dogs
on the fox's tail...

349
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:25,525
Can it!

350
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:35,285
Damn it!

351
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:38,956
I can't take this!

352
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:42,292
He was always right on time before.

353
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,381
- Thank God!
- Finally.

354
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,134
Morning!

355
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,595
Are you nuts?
Close those blinds!

356
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:19,454
Gentlemen,
I hereby open this meeting.

357
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:23,917
I declare all division leaders
of this organization present.

358
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,920
I assume you're authorized
to make binding decisions

359
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:29,756
for your divisions.

360
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:33,760
Good. We'll dispense
with the preliminaries,

361
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:36,304
as we all know why we're here.

362
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:41,435
An outsider is ruining
our business and our reputation.

363
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:44,146
Measures taken by the police

364
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:48,734
and the daily raids
to catch this child murderer

365
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:52,571
are hampering our activities
to an almost unbearable degree.

366
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:55,449
We can no longer tolerate the fact

367
00:33:55,616 --> 00:34:00,662
that we're not safe now in any hotel,
bar, café or even private home

368
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:03,290
from the clutches of the police.

369
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:04,499
Very true.

370
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:06,752
This state of affairs must end.

371
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:10,547
Things must return to normal
or we'll go under.

372
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:14,301
Our coffers will soon be depleted.

373
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:17,888
If we can't get funds to support
the wives of those members

374
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:21,641
who currently enjoy
room and board at state expense,

375
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:27,439
I don't know where we'll find
the money to carry out our plans.

376
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:29,649
Our reputation is suffering as well.

377
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:32,652
The police seek
the murderer in our fold.

378
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:37,032
Gentlemen, when I run head-on
into an officer from the squad,

379
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:39,701
he knows the potential risks,
and so do I.

380
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:43,163
If either dies in the line of duty, fine.
Occupational hazard.

381
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:47,167
But we must draw a firm line
between ourselves

382
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:50,045
and this man they're looking for!

383
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:52,339
We conduct our business
in order to survive,

384
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:54,800
but this monster
has no right to survive!

385
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:57,052
He must be killed,
eliminated, exterminated!

386
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:59,471
Without mercy or compassion!

387
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:05,143
Gentlemen,

388
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:08,855
our members must be able
to go about their business again

389
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:14,486
without frantic cops
in their way at every turn.

390
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:15,987
I invite...

391
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:20,700
...your views, gentlemen.

392
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:26,915
Step up ID checks,
comb the entire city,

393
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:31,545
and raids...
relentless, ever tougher raids!

394
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:34,714
We need informers!

395
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:38,051
We must know the police's plans
almost before they do themselves!

396
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:40,178
The girls gotta work the cops more!

397
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:44,766
How often has one of us been nabbed
'cause his gal ratted on him to the cops?

398
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:46,852
Now they can rat on the cops!

399
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:51,148
Every resident, every landlord,

400
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:55,152
every property owner

401
00:35:55,444 --> 00:36:01,074
must be forced to consent
to meticulous searches of his property

402
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:04,578
for the slightest of clues.

403
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:08,957
What if we...
We have our connections.

404
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:14,462
What if we put
an article in the papers

405
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:19,426
that our syndicates...
I mean, our organization...

406
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:23,555
doesn't wish to be lumped in
together with this pig,

407
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:26,600
and that the cops should look
for this guy somewhere else.

408
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:28,310
He's not even a real crook!

409
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:31,062
This man may well be...

410
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:35,567
when not engaged
in the actual act of killing...

411
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:40,530
a harmless, upstanding citizen

412
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:42,157
who wouldn't hurt a fly.

413
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:45,952
In his right mind, perhaps he plays
marbles with his landlady's kids

414
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:48,288
or plays cards with friends.

415
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:52,167
Without what I'll call

416
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:55,170
the innocuousness
of these murderers' private lives,

417
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:59,799
it's inconceivable that someone
like Grossmann or Haarmann

418
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:04,137
could have lived right next door
to their neighbors for years

419
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:08,141
without arousing
the faintest trace of suspicion!

420
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:11,311
This is where we must focus
the public's attention.

421
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:13,647
The public must cooperate.

422
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:17,192
I'll tell you about public cooperation!

423
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:20,445
Just thinking of it makes me puke.

424
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:23,448
I beg your pardon, Commissioner.

425
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:26,910
But ain't it the truth?

426
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:31,331
What the devil has public cooperation
gotten us so far?

427
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:36,503
Piles of letters
full of the most outrageous slander!

428
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:38,004
Very true.

429
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:41,258
They alert homicide
whenever a chimney sweep walks by.

430
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:42,717
That's right.

431
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:45,804
But when you really want
reliable information from them,

432
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,556
then they suddenly haven't got a clue.

433
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:52,394
Why, they just can't seem
to remember a thing.

434
00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:56,856
There's your public cooperation
for you!

435
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:00,860
I believe you're exaggerating a bit,
Lohmann.

436
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:04,322
It can't really be that bad, can it?

437
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:07,367
But it is, Commissioner!

438
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:11,705
Most of the public
still takes the position,

439
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:13,915
"How does this concern me?"

440
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:18,795
The idea that
each individual is responsible

441
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:22,882
for what happens to the poorest,
most anonymous child on the street

442
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:26,845
hasn't even dawned
on the public at large!

443
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:31,850
I've got another idea.

444
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,893
There was this magician.

445
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:37,564
Te... Tele...
I can't remember what you call it.

446
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:40,942
Anyway, he could conjure up
hidden pennies out of handkerchiefs.

447
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:44,112
The reward is still
far too little money.

448
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:50,744
The man who leads us
to the murderer should get a fortune.

449
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:53,288
None of this is anything new.

450
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:55,206
This is all leading nowhere.

451
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:59,586
So we just wait for the police
to catch the guy instead?

452
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:06,426
The difficulties
in solving crimes of this nature

453
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:09,888
are, in my experience,
often insurmountable,

454
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:12,724
since perpetrator and victim

455
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:16,519
are often brought together
by mere chance.

456
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:20,357
The instincts of the moment
drive the murderer's actions.

457
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:24,235
The victim is found and identified,

458
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:26,780
his or her last known whereabouts
are determined,

459
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:28,656
and then...

460
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:33,119
then comes the big question mark.

461
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:37,540
These children vanish
without a trace.

462
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:42,712
And when they're found...

463
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:51,179
Well, we all know the state
in which we've found them.

464
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,850
And the perpetrator...

465
00:39:58,145 --> 00:40:00,105
It's a fact well-known to all of us

466
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:04,234
that murderers like this
rarely leave a clue behind.

467
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:08,655
That's what makes our work so hard,
our successes so few.

468
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:12,367
The police have been after
this murderer for eight months now.

469
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:17,205
They'll only get him by accident now.
- We can't wait for that.

470
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:19,833
No, we'll go broke by then.

471
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,126
What, then?

472
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:40,437
We have to catch him...

473
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:43,189
ourselves.

474
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:50,405
Yes, that's what we must do.

475
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:56,119
There is perhaps one other way.

476
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:59,747
I'm quite certain that information
on the individual in question

477
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:05,378
must already exist somewhere.

478
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:09,549
Being the severely pathological case
that he is,

479
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:14,220
he has no doubt already had some kind
of contact with the authorities.

480
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:18,808
That's why all health care facilities,

481
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:22,729
prisons, clinics and insane asylums

482
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:26,816
must be encouraged
to cooperate with us unequivocally.

483
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:30,570
We specifically need information

484
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:35,158
on those released after being deemed
harmless to society

485
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:38,828
but who, due to their inclinations,

486
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:41,915
could be the murderer.

487
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:45,293
We must cover the city
with a net of informers.

488
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:50,423
Every square mile must be
under constant surveillance.

489
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:54,177
No child in this city must take
a single step without us knowing it.

490
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:56,679
- Fine, but how?
- And who?

491
00:41:56,805 --> 00:42:00,517
It must be people who can go
anywhere without causing a stir,

492
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:03,770
follow anyone
without attracting attention,

493
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:07,941
follow any child to any house
without arousing suspicion.

494
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:12,445
In short, people whom the killer
would never suspect.

495
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:14,781
- But who?
- There are no such people!

496
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:16,950
- Who could do that?
- Who?

497
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:22,497
The beggars.

498
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:25,250
The organization of beggars!

499
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:57,949
MR. CREDIT IS DEAD AND BURIED -
THE MANAGEMENT

500
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:06,457
Blood pudding's on the upswing.

501
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:11,504
God, this cheese stinks so good.

502
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:20,179
Take that, you sons of bitches!

503
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:33,276
Hey, stop snoring.
You'll wake up the lice.

504
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:44,370
Two, four, six...

505
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:48,833
NO BEGGARS OR PEDDLERS

506
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:54,922
SANDWICHES

507
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:05,933
Bread-and-butter sandwich,
lukewarm response.

508
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:11,606
Black Friday for roast beef.

509
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:34,128
All right.
Now come the courtyards.

510
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:39,092
Yes, from number 1 to 88.

511
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:44,013
Next.

512
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:52,897
You're responsible for the courtyards
on Hauptstrasse from 1 to 88.

513
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:54,565
Got it.

514
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,109
What's next?

515
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:59,612
Hauptstrasse, from number 89...

516
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:02,198
to 196.

517
00:45:02,324 --> 00:45:04,409
Hauptstrasse,

518
00:45:04,743 --> 00:45:08,955
number 89 to 196.

519
00:45:09,581 --> 00:45:13,793
Member number?
- 3795. Emil Dustermann.

520
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:32,770
Well, Emil, maybe
you'll win the 15,000.

521
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:35,314
I've got my fingers crossed.

522
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:37,150
Knock on wood.

523
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:21,736
My heartfelt thanks,
ladies and gentlemen.

524
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:26,157
Thank you.

525
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:21,128
"In searching homes,
be on the lookout for any clue

526
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:25,091
which could establish the origin
of the murderer's letter to the Courier.

527
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:27,260
Be on the lookout as well

528
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:30,555
for an old wooden table..."

529
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:33,182
Idiot!

530
00:47:38,772 --> 00:47:40,439
"...or red pencil..."

531
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:42,859
Come in.

532
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:47,613
"... or writing paper
of the type used by the killer".

533
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:53,452
Inspector, here are reports on mental
patients who've been released as cured

534
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:56,497
or deemed harmless
over the last five years.

535
00:47:56,623 --> 00:47:58,833
Reports from every
private and public institute,

536
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:02,169
as well as from
municipal hospitals and asylums.

537
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:18,603
And here's a list
of their present addresses.

538
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:57,516
Good day.
Does a Mr. Beckert live here?

539
00:48:57,643 --> 00:48:58,851
Pardon me?

540
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:01,562
Does a Mr. Beckert live here?

541
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:04,857
I'm afraid I don't understand.
I'm a bit hard of hearing.

542
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:06,734
You don't say.

543
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:09,654
Does a Mr. Beckert live here?

544
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:14,450
Mr. Beckert... yes, he does.
But he just stepped out.

545
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:17,828
I had hoped to speak with him.

546
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:20,998
I'm from the tax office.

547
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:23,501
The tax office. Oh, my Lord!

548
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:26,337
Perhaps you'd like to wait for him...

549
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:28,214
Yes, thank you.

550
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:39,308
- Please have a seat.
- Thank you.

551
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:55,783
- Perhaps you'd like something to read.
- Thank you. Most kind.

552
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:58,786
THE GENERAL GAZETTE

553
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:00,621
Tell me, Mrs. Winkler,

554
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:03,541
does Mr. Beckert
subscribe to any newspapers?

555
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:07,420
Mr. Beckert?
No, he always borrows mine.

556
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:10,131
I see. Thank you.

557
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:26,827
Mommy!
I wanted to meet you halfway!

558
00:53:27,078 --> 00:53:29,622
Child, you mustn't do that.

559
00:53:29,998 --> 00:53:31,540
You know why.

560
00:54:16,294 --> 00:54:18,170
Good day.
What would you like?

561
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:19,880
Coffee.

562
00:54:20,548 --> 00:54:23,717
No, a vermouth.
No, a cognac.

563
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:51,036
Here you are.

564
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:58,252
Another.

565
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:33,912
Check.

566
00:55:34,247 --> 00:55:37,041
Two cognacs...
that's 1.65, please.

567
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:41,420
Thank you very much.

568
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:51,347
Number 24: Beckert.
Doesn't take the Courier.

569
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:54,099
Table: polished mahogany,
with tablecloth.

570
00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:57,936
No traces of red pencil.
In fact, no writing materials of any kind.

571
00:55:58,271 --> 00:55:59,813
Printed matter found in wastebasket:

572
00:55:59,939 --> 00:56:01,982
cigar ad and a postcard

573
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:04,318
with flowers
and "Regards, Paul" on it,

574
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:06,278
but no address of sender.

575
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:09,782
An empty cigarette pack, Ariston brand,
a bag of candy...

576
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:15,371
Just a moment.

577
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:20,793
Ariston?

578
00:56:32,013 --> 00:56:34,056
What was that?

579
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:49,780
I'd like the file
on the Marga Perl murder case.

580
00:56:52,033 --> 00:56:53,826
Thank you very much.

581
00:57:01,793 --> 00:57:03,544
That's odd.

582
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:07,464
I've heard that before.

583
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:12,094
It was...

584
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:16,557
It was...

585
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:38,412
<i>Hey, Heinrich!</i>

586
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:45,794
What is it?

587
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:51,258
What's wrong?
- Listen. Someone's whistling.

588
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:54,261
Can't you hear it?

589
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:55,846
There.

590
00:57:58,433 --> 00:57:59,975
Now he's stopped.

591
00:58:01,561 --> 00:58:03,979
Did you see
the guy who was whistling?

592
00:58:04,105 --> 00:58:06,440
Yes, I can still see him.

593
00:58:06,566 --> 00:58:12,196
Heinrich, he's talking to a little girl
and walking her down the street.

594
00:58:12,405 --> 00:58:16,325
- After him, quick, and don't lose him!
- Why?

595
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:20,829
The day little Elsie Beckmann
was killed,

596
00:58:20,955 --> 00:58:23,665
a man bought a balloon from me.

597
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:26,835
He was with a little girl...

598
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:35,761
and he whistled just like that!

599
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:06,143
Damn it, man!

600
01:00:06,352 --> 01:00:09,313
Are you crazy,
throwing orange peels on the ground?

601
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:11,690
A man could slip and break his neck!
Unbelievable!

602
01:00:11,816 --> 01:00:14,067
I should report you to the police!

603
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:16,820
Outrageous behavior!

604
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:20,240
Hey, mister.

605
01:00:33,546 --> 01:00:35,297
Aha! Here it is.

606
01:00:35,548 --> 01:00:41,428
"In a 150-foot radius
of the crime scene,

607
01:00:41,554 --> 01:00:44,806
three cigarette butts of the Ariston brand
were found". There you have it.

608
01:00:45,516 --> 01:00:48,477
Yes, it may be
the same brand of cigarettes,

609
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:52,064
but there was no old wooden table.

610
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:58,570
Of course, he could have written
that letter somewhere else.

611
01:01:03,284 --> 01:01:04,993
Good God!

612
01:01:06,412 --> 01:01:07,871
<i>The window ledge!</i>

613
01:01:21,219 --> 01:01:22,844
You're right.

614
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:26,848
Just a minute.

615
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:35,565
Red pencil.

616
01:01:38,778 --> 01:01:40,529
My God, finally!

617
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:44,408
We're finally on his trail.

618
01:01:47,161 --> 01:01:48,412
What?

619
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:51,123
They're on his trail?

620
01:01:52,291 --> 01:01:55,043
<i>- Did they find him?
- The beggars found him.</i>

621
01:01:55,294 --> 01:01:57,629
- His whistling gave him away.
- They put a mark on him.

622
01:01:57,755 --> 01:01:59,172
Shut up!

623
01:01:59,632 --> 01:02:01,258
What did you say?

624
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:05,470
They're following the mark.
He isn't out of sight for a second.

625
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:09,641
<i>His every move is being watched.</i>

626
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:18,919
- Mister.
- What is it?

627
01:03:19,045 --> 01:03:21,880
- You got some white stuff on your coat.
- Where?

628
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:24,257
On your shoulder.

629
01:03:29,055 --> 01:03:31,264
Here, I'll wipe it off.

630
01:03:38,064 --> 01:03:40,857
- What's the matter?
- Come on. We're leaving.

631
01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:15,493
He didn't come out this way.
We would've seen him.

632
01:05:15,661 --> 01:05:16,786
Out of the question!

633
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:20,916
- Well, he didn't turn back.
- He has to be somewhere, damn it!

634
01:05:25,171 --> 01:05:28,340
Maybe he's hiding
inside the building.

635
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:50,028
Closing time!

636
01:05:50,154 --> 01:05:54,324
We can't let him get away in the crowd!
If he slips through now...

637
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:56,034
They're starting to come out!

638
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:58,536
Out in the street,
and keep your eyes peeled!

639
01:06:07,254 --> 01:06:09,214
Excuse me, may I ask you a question?

640
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:13,051
My trip is tomorrow.
I start in Königsberg...

641
01:06:14,929 --> 01:06:17,764
No, in my condition
I can't eat anything like that...

642
01:06:18,015 --> 01:06:20,892
The boss came to my office today...

643
01:06:23,187 --> 01:06:25,021
Turn off the light.

644
01:06:25,147 --> 01:06:28,441
He'll get suspicious
if he comes home and sees it on.

645
01:06:33,155 --> 01:06:35,031
What time is it, anyway?

646
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:38,451
Almost 6:30.

647
01:06:56,262 --> 01:06:58,722
He's gotta still be inside!

648
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:02,100
He definitely didn't come out
with the office crowd.

649
01:07:09,942 --> 01:07:11,651
No, just a moment.

650
01:07:12,653 --> 01:07:15,488
The beggars have called for backup
and surrounded the whole building.

651
01:07:15,614 --> 01:07:18,408
They figure the guy's hiding
in the building.

652
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:25,707
What sort of building is it?

653
01:07:27,334 --> 01:07:29,502
What sort of building is it?

654
01:07:29,628 --> 01:07:32,213
Nothing but offices.

655
01:07:33,591 --> 01:07:35,633
I don't know what's in the basement.

656
01:07:36,302 --> 01:07:39,262
There's a branch of the local
savings bank on the ground floor,

657
01:07:39,597 --> 01:07:43,808
and the second to sixth floors
are nothing but offices.

658
01:07:43,934 --> 01:07:45,518
Above that is the attic space.

659
01:07:51,317 --> 01:07:53,151
This is unbelievable.

660
01:07:54,945 --> 01:07:56,613
Anyone still in there?

661
01:08:04,538 --> 01:08:06,164
Anyone still in here?

662
01:08:25,184 --> 01:08:26,768
What the devil!

663
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,187
Anybody still in here?

664
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:41,407
Damn carelessness!

665
01:08:44,662 --> 01:08:46,121
All that trouble for one door.

666
01:09:09,103 --> 01:09:10,979
Seems the guy's cornered now.

667
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:13,898
I think we should tip
the cops off right away.

668
01:09:14,024 --> 01:09:16,109
- I agree.
- Let's not waste time!

669
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:21,614
Stay by the phone
and call back in a few minutes.

670
01:09:21,866 --> 01:09:23,199
What is it?

671
01:09:23,367 --> 01:09:25,702
Are you crazy or something?
The police?

672
01:09:26,036 --> 01:09:28,705
No! We're gonna get
this guy ourselves!

673
01:09:28,914 --> 01:09:30,582
Listen, the time now is...

674
01:09:32,084 --> 01:09:32,959
8:00.

675
01:09:33,085 --> 01:09:37,380
All right. 9:00... 10:00...

676
01:09:37,631 --> 01:09:38,756
At 11:00!

677
01:10:02,907 --> 01:10:06,576
Evening. Did you know
your gate isn't closed?

678
01:10:06,702 --> 01:10:09,329
What? That's impossible!

679
01:10:09,955 --> 01:10:12,999
Why I just... Wait, it is!

680
01:10:15,794 --> 01:10:18,463
Open up, quick!
And not a sound!

681
01:10:18,589 --> 01:10:20,798
Come on! Move it!

682
01:10:21,133 --> 01:10:23,218
Let's go!

683
01:10:23,344 --> 01:10:25,261
Come on, move it!

684
01:10:53,165 --> 01:10:55,625
How many other watchmen
are in the building?

685
01:10:58,587 --> 01:11:00,713
Don't want to answer, eh?

686
01:11:02,341 --> 01:11:03,967
Very well.

687
01:11:37,668 --> 01:11:39,711
There are still two watchmen
on their rounds.

688
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:05,236
Goddamn it!

689
01:12:05,404 --> 01:12:08,197
Damn piece of crap!

690
01:12:14,997 --> 01:12:17,081
Goddamned lock!

691
01:12:30,929 --> 01:12:33,014
Damn it to hell!

692
01:12:33,307 --> 01:12:34,766
Shit!

693
01:13:29,988 --> 01:13:32,657
Careful where you shine those lights!

694
01:13:32,908 --> 01:13:35,535
And don't stomp around
like elephants!

695
01:13:35,661 --> 01:13:37,453
He's not in the basement.

696
01:13:37,579 --> 01:13:39,789
We went through it all
and found nothing.

697
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:43,334
Two men are still going
through the boiler room.

698
01:13:43,919 --> 01:13:45,128
Hold it!

699
01:13:45,254 --> 01:13:46,838
This is the last one.

700
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:49,674
Go up and join Emil.
He needs help.

701
01:13:57,307 --> 01:13:58,850
Safecracker sent me.

702
01:13:59,101 --> 01:14:00,184
All right.

703
01:14:01,061 --> 01:14:02,353
Listen carefully.

704
01:14:02,855 --> 01:14:07,150
This is a new type of time clock.

705
01:14:07,943 --> 01:14:10,194
Here's a general diagram.

706
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:12,822
If they're not set
at exactly the right minute,

707
01:14:12,948 --> 01:14:16,993
an alarm automatically goes off
at the nearest police station. Get it?

708
01:14:19,788 --> 01:14:21,330
You got it?

709
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:24,208
- I'm not an idiot!
- Well...

710
01:14:26,003 --> 01:14:29,672
He's not in the boiler room
or the coal room.

711
01:14:29,798 --> 01:14:31,924
We turned over every piece of coal.

712
01:14:35,179 --> 01:14:36,345
Hey!

713
01:14:36,722 --> 01:14:39,265
Are you nuts?

714
01:14:39,391 --> 01:14:44,228
What if the doors are wired?
You want the police here in five minutes?

715
01:14:45,772 --> 01:14:49,442
We gotta get in if we're gonna
search the whole place!

716
01:14:49,693 --> 01:14:51,903
But not through the door, you idiot!

717
01:14:52,070 --> 01:14:54,280
Go through the ceiling
of the office above!

718
01:15:00,913 --> 01:15:02,205
Nothing.

719
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:40,409
All right. Down we go.

720
01:16:30,961 --> 01:16:33,004
Hey, what's up?

721
01:16:33,505 --> 01:16:35,006
Hey! What is it?

722
01:16:35,132 --> 01:16:37,383
Wait a minute!
Answer me, damn it!

723
01:16:37,509 --> 01:16:40,011
What's going on?
- I heard some banging!

724
01:16:41,305 --> 01:16:44,557
- Where are you off to?
- Why are you running?

725
01:16:49,229 --> 01:16:51,147
<i>Wait, damn it!</i>

726
01:16:52,482 --> 01:16:54,358
I've gotta see Safecracker!

727
01:16:54,526 --> 01:16:58,779
He's in the attic, I tell you!
I heard him knocking!

728
01:17:15,797 --> 01:17:16,881
Quiet!

729
01:18:06,264 --> 01:18:08,766
Go on! He has to be in there!

730
01:18:09,810 --> 01:18:11,602
Here's the light switch.

731
01:18:13,605 --> 01:18:15,398
Force the locks.

732
01:18:15,857 --> 01:18:17,274
Come on. Hurry up!

733
01:18:28,954 --> 01:18:32,498
Got him! I found the guy!
He's in the attic!

734
01:18:32,624 --> 01:18:35,126
I heard someone banging,
and I told Safecracker.

735
01:18:35,293 --> 01:18:38,295
He's up there with eight men.
They'll get him any moment now.

736
01:18:38,422 --> 01:18:40,589
Just came down to fill you in.

737
01:18:40,716 --> 01:18:43,676
If I hadn't been alert,
we could've looked for him for hours!

738
01:18:43,802 --> 01:18:44,969
The watchman!

739
01:18:50,267 --> 01:18:52,935
Three... one... four.

740
01:18:53,311 --> 01:18:54,812
314.

741
01:19:06,950 --> 01:19:09,326
- Everybody out!
- What?

742
01:19:09,494 --> 01:19:13,497
- The cops'll be here in five minutes.
- Damn it! Who called 'em?

743
01:19:13,623 --> 01:19:15,833
- The watchman rang the alarm.
- Let's scram!

744
01:19:16,168 --> 01:19:17,418
Hold it!

745
01:19:17,669 --> 01:19:19,128
Quiet down!

746
01:19:20,005 --> 01:19:22,631
Five more minutes,
six more storage sheds.

747
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:25,009
Move it! Get going!

748
01:19:25,302 --> 01:19:27,720
Not like that!
Out of the way!

749
01:19:35,687 --> 01:19:37,730
<i>- He's not in here.
- Next door!</i>

750
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:40,065
<i>Come on! Faster!</i>

751
01:19:44,821 --> 01:19:47,531
<i>- He's not here either.
- Move on! Next door!</i>

752
01:19:54,039 --> 01:19:57,208
<i>Quickly! We've only got
three minutes left!</i>

753
01:19:58,627 --> 01:20:00,628
<i>No padlock on this one...
he must be here!</i>

754
01:20:00,712 --> 01:20:01,796
<i>Open it!</i>

755
01:20:01,922 --> 01:20:03,839
<i>- Something's jammed inside.
- Let me do it!</i>

756
01:20:03,965 --> 01:20:06,091
<i>Hurry! Only one minute left!</i>

757
01:20:10,430 --> 01:20:12,932
<i>There he is, the dog!</i>

758
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:16,185
Come on! Move it!

759
01:20:18,230 --> 01:20:19,647
Everybody out!

760
01:20:20,565 --> 01:20:22,608
Get out while you can, damn it!

761
01:20:22,818 --> 01:20:24,693
Move it!

762
01:20:26,613 --> 01:20:28,864
For Christ's sake, get going!

763
01:20:30,325 --> 01:20:32,243
What's keeping the others?
- They're coming!

764
01:20:32,410 --> 01:20:36,747
If not, they might as well stay here,
with or without the guy!

765
01:20:37,582 --> 01:20:40,376
What in the hell is keeping them?

766
01:20:40,627 --> 01:20:42,586
Finally! Thank God!

767
01:20:43,129 --> 01:20:47,800
Quick now! Go!
Make it snappy!

768
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:23,752
<i>He's not down here.</i>

769
01:21:25,297 --> 01:21:28,799
<i>Hey! Who pulled up the rope?</i>

770
01:21:29,968 --> 01:21:33,554
Hey, who pulled up the rope?

771
01:21:35,807 --> 01:21:37,141
Bunch of morons!

772
01:21:52,157 --> 01:21:53,532
Hello there.

773
01:21:53,658 --> 01:21:55,034
<i>Hands up!</i>

774
01:21:55,368 --> 01:21:59,121
How can I put my hands up
when I'm holding on to the rope?

775
01:21:59,247 --> 01:22:00,456
<i>Come out of there!</i>

776
01:22:10,884 --> 01:22:12,718
I'm really innocent this time...

777
01:22:13,887 --> 01:22:15,554
...like a newborn babe.

778
01:22:20,018 --> 01:22:22,561
This may surprise you, Franz...

779
01:22:24,105 --> 01:22:25,522
but I believe you.

780
01:22:29,277 --> 01:22:32,196
Then everything's in order,

781
01:22:32,364 --> 01:22:33,822
and I can go now, right?

782
01:22:34,032 --> 01:22:35,908
Just a moment.

783
01:22:38,703 --> 01:22:39,870
Cigarette?

784
01:22:40,038 --> 01:22:41,538
Uh-oh.

785
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:56,011
I'll take your word for it, Franz...

786
01:22:57,389 --> 01:22:59,473
provided...

787
01:23:00,392 --> 01:23:04,103
you can tell me...

788
01:23:05,522 --> 01:23:09,650
who the man was
that you were looking for

789
01:23:09,776 --> 01:23:12,736
and that you found in that building.

790
01:23:13,238 --> 01:23:14,905
I don't understand, Inspector.

791
01:23:16,157 --> 01:23:18,283
A man, you say?

792
01:23:19,786 --> 01:23:24,331
I know nothing about that.
There must be some mistake.

793
01:23:25,333 --> 01:23:27,418
I know nothing.

794
01:23:27,544 --> 01:23:29,420
Nothing at all.

795
01:23:30,171 --> 01:23:31,797
Of course.

796
01:23:32,757 --> 01:23:34,591
There's just one thing I don't get:

797
01:23:34,759 --> 01:23:36,552
why you're covering up

798
01:23:36,761 --> 01:23:39,096
for the gang
who left you in the lurch.

799
01:23:40,932 --> 01:23:44,101
Fine friends, running off
when things heat up,

800
01:23:44,227 --> 01:23:46,145
leaving you right in the fire.

801
01:23:47,022 --> 01:23:48,564
Phooey!

802
01:23:50,775 --> 01:23:54,903
That ploy won't work with me,
Inspector.

803
01:24:21,723 --> 01:24:23,223
Listen...

804
01:24:28,938 --> 01:24:31,106
What can happen to me anyway?

805
01:24:31,691 --> 01:24:34,359
<i>Maybe a little property damage...
so what?</i>

806
01:24:35,278 --> 01:24:36,695
<i>Nothing was pinched!</i>

807
01:24:36,821 --> 01:24:38,822
<i>But something was pinched,
my friend!</i>

808
01:24:39,449 --> 01:24:40,657
In fact, a good deal.

809
01:24:40,784 --> 01:24:43,410
What? Something got pinched?

810
01:24:45,288 --> 01:24:46,872
How much?

811
01:24:46,998 --> 01:24:50,417
Tell me what you know
and I'll do the same.

812
01:24:50,877 --> 01:24:53,587
I already told you.
I know nothing.

813
01:24:56,132 --> 01:24:57,633
Very well.

814
01:25:00,887 --> 01:25:03,180
Give it some thought, Franz.

815
01:25:04,307 --> 01:25:10,521
Leave a man alone
for a couple hours...

816
01:25:11,523 --> 01:25:16,568
and a lot comes back to him
that he couldn't remember before.

817
01:25:18,905 --> 01:25:20,364
Take him away.

818
01:25:36,381 --> 01:25:38,215
Send the night watchman in.

819
01:25:41,553 --> 01:25:43,387
Mr. Damowatz.

820
01:25:50,353 --> 01:25:51,854
Please sit down.

821
01:25:54,232 --> 01:25:58,068
Now then, you said
in your statement...

822
01:25:58,862 --> 01:26:02,739
Listen carefully, in case
you have to testify under oath later.

823
01:26:06,077 --> 01:26:10,873
You clearly heard one of the burglars
say to the guy guarding you,

824
01:26:11,332 --> 01:26:15,169
"We got him. I found the guy.
He's in the attic".

825
01:26:15,295 --> 01:26:18,255
Is that correct?
- Yes, Inspector.

826
01:26:19,883 --> 01:26:26,096
Yes, I'll swear to that anytime.

827
01:26:27,265 --> 01:26:28,390
Good.

828
01:26:28,516 --> 01:26:31,018
Go home now
and recover from your ordeal.

829
01:26:31,311 --> 01:26:34,229
But please remain available
for further questioning.

830
01:26:34,397 --> 01:26:36,607
Of course, Inspector.

831
01:26:39,027 --> 01:26:40,694
Good morning, Inspector.

832
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:42,196
Morning.

833
01:26:55,919 --> 01:26:59,338
Tell me, is Inspector Lohmann
in the building?

834
01:27:00,548 --> 01:27:03,425
He's talking to someone?
No, it doesn't matter.

835
01:27:03,801 --> 01:27:06,303
I'll come over myself.

836
01:27:09,224 --> 01:27:11,558
What? I see.

837
01:27:12,393 --> 01:27:14,811
Hasn't come home yet, eh?

838
01:27:16,064 --> 01:27:18,774
Did you keep an eye
on the old Winkler woman too?

839
01:27:19,025 --> 01:27:20,400
Come in.

840
01:27:21,152 --> 01:27:22,486
Come in!

841
01:27:23,821 --> 01:27:26,114
<i>- Am I disturbing you?
- No, come in.</i>

842
01:27:27,575 --> 01:27:30,327
Listen, the whole block
is surrounded.

843
01:27:30,536 --> 01:27:33,997
If he decides to go home,
he has to run into us.

844
01:27:34,499 --> 01:27:36,708
So just keep on waiting.

845
01:27:37,502 --> 01:27:40,212
If anything happens,
I'll be here at the precinct.

846
01:27:44,634 --> 01:27:46,009
Damn it!

847
01:27:52,642 --> 01:27:54,142
What do you want?

848
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:56,687
I wanted...

849
01:27:58,106 --> 01:28:00,023
to ask a favor of you.

850
01:28:03,361 --> 01:28:05,195
Dishwater again!

851
01:28:05,530 --> 01:28:07,531
I wanted to ask you...

852
01:28:08,533 --> 01:28:11,201
Read this first.

853
01:28:17,625 --> 01:28:19,376
- A statement?
- Yeah.

854
01:28:20,211 --> 01:28:22,212
An office building was broken into.

855
01:28:29,637 --> 01:28:31,179
Bennostrasse?

856
01:28:31,723 --> 01:28:33,432
<i>That's a respectable part of town.</i>

857
01:28:35,476 --> 01:28:37,644
<i>Perhaps not that respectable after all.</i>

858
01:28:39,355 --> 01:28:40,772
<i>Hell, this is getting serious!</i>

859
01:28:49,824 --> 01:28:52,284
<i>What the... Did they mean to empty
the whole joint?</i>

860
01:28:54,245 --> 01:28:57,539
<i>What could they have been
looking for in the coal?</i>

861
01:28:58,916 --> 01:29:01,543
<i>Incredible! Unbelievable!</i>

862
01:29:04,922 --> 01:29:06,381
<i>I'll be damned!</i>

863
01:29:10,303 --> 01:29:12,095
<i>This is madness!</i>

864
01:29:15,266 --> 01:29:18,643
<i>Ah, so they were after
the savings bank!</i>

865
01:29:20,021 --> 01:29:22,105
<i>Good God!
What could this mean?</i>

866
01:29:23,775 --> 01:29:26,109
<i>I don't understand at all.</i>

867
01:29:26,444 --> 01:29:28,570
<i>They didn't even touch it?</i>

868
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:31,990
<i>Must've been a bunch of real idiots!</i>

869
01:29:34,535 --> 01:29:36,536
I'll be damned!

870
01:29:36,704 --> 01:29:38,997
Isn't that something?

871
01:29:39,248 --> 01:29:42,250
Nothing stolen,
but a man was carried off.

872
01:29:42,460 --> 01:29:44,378
God knows where they took him.

873
01:29:44,629 --> 01:29:46,296
That's just great.

874
01:29:46,631 --> 01:29:49,549
And Franz isn't talking.

875
01:29:49,675 --> 01:29:51,134
He's afraid, of course.

876
01:29:51,803 --> 01:29:56,348
I know him well. Guy like him would
rather jump out the fifth-floor window

877
01:29:56,474 --> 01:29:58,433
than be mixed up in a murder rap.

878
01:30:00,395 --> 01:30:05,899
What if we could
get at him from that angle?

879
01:30:06,901 --> 01:30:10,487
Lohmann, if you'd be willing
to help me out...

880
01:30:13,908 --> 01:30:15,784
Very clever.

881
01:30:16,285 --> 01:30:18,245
I see the wheels turning.

882
01:30:19,997 --> 01:30:22,958
Let's send for this Franz.

883
01:30:27,088 --> 01:30:28,713
You're wanted for questioning.

884
01:30:30,049 --> 01:30:33,051
What? They sent four guys for me?

885
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:35,804
What's this about?
- Move it!

886
01:30:59,245 --> 01:31:01,913
"Homicide squad.

887
01:31:02,665 --> 01:31:06,334
Inspector Karl Lohmann".

888
01:31:11,799 --> 01:31:13,925
What do you want with me?

889
01:31:14,343 --> 01:31:17,262
What have I got to do
with the homicide squad?

890
01:31:28,232 --> 01:31:30,066
Yes, young man...

891
01:31:31,152 --> 01:31:33,403
your case has been turned over to me.

892
01:31:37,366 --> 01:31:39,075
But why?

893
01:31:41,787 --> 01:31:43,038
Why?

894
01:31:44,916 --> 01:31:48,752
You boys did your work
a little too well.

895
01:31:55,426 --> 01:31:57,302
<i>One of the watchmen...</i>

896
01:32:06,938 --> 01:32:08,021
Dead?

897
01:32:13,277 --> 01:32:15,195
Accessory to murder.

898
01:32:16,906 --> 01:32:18,406
Nasty business.

899
01:32:18,533 --> 01:32:21,576
Inspector, I've had enough!

900
01:32:21,702 --> 01:32:23,745
I want no part of this!

901
01:32:23,871 --> 01:32:26,706
I'll tell you everything I know!

902
01:32:27,750 --> 01:32:30,126
Very sensible,
but, unfortunately, too late.

903
01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:33,004
It can't be too late!

904
01:32:33,130 --> 01:32:35,507
It can't be!

905
01:32:36,050 --> 01:32:38,176
I'll tell you everything!

906
01:32:38,970 --> 01:32:42,389
Even what we were looking for
in that damn building.

907
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:44,015
Well...

908
01:32:45,309 --> 01:32:47,102
The child murderer!

909
01:32:57,738 --> 01:32:59,030
What?

910
01:32:59,949 --> 01:33:01,241
Who?

911
01:33:01,659 --> 01:33:03,868
The child murderer, Inspector.

912
01:33:10,167 --> 01:33:11,835
Just a moment.

913
01:33:29,979 --> 01:33:32,439
This had to happen to me!

914
01:33:35,901 --> 01:33:38,653
Me, of all people.

915
01:33:46,203 --> 01:33:48,079
Come sit down, my boy.

916
01:33:52,293 --> 01:33:56,421
We're gonna level
with each other, got it?

917
01:33:56,964 --> 01:33:58,214
Certainly, Inspector.

918
01:33:58,424 --> 01:34:01,176
And God help you
if you pull something.

919
01:34:02,219 --> 01:34:03,720
Now then...

920
01:34:03,971 --> 01:34:06,389
what have you boys got to do
with the murderer,

921
01:34:06,807 --> 01:34:09,434
and where was the guy taken?

922
01:34:11,896 --> 01:34:14,814
Well, Inspector...

923
01:34:16,233 --> 01:34:20,570
you know the old
Kuntz & Levy distillery?

924
01:34:21,155 --> 01:34:23,907
<i>The one that went belly-up
in the Depression?</i>

925
01:34:24,033 --> 01:34:26,451
<i>That's the one.</i>

926
01:34:26,577 --> 01:34:29,871
<i>Since then, the building's stood empty,
and no one gives a damn about it.</i>

927
01:34:50,101 --> 01:34:52,435
Get out here! Move it!

928
01:34:55,272 --> 01:34:57,107
Let me go!

929
01:35:05,950 --> 01:35:07,951
What have I done to you?

930
01:35:08,077 --> 01:35:09,160
You swine!

931
01:35:09,286 --> 01:35:12,580
Let go of me!

932
01:35:14,959 --> 01:35:17,711
Bastards!

933
01:35:18,504 --> 01:35:21,214
Swine!
What do you want from me?

934
01:35:21,549 --> 01:35:23,299
What do you want...

935
01:35:53,330 --> 01:35:54,581
Help!

936
01:35:54,707 --> 01:35:58,626
Help! Let me out of here!

937
01:35:59,003 --> 01:36:01,171
I want out!

938
01:36:01,380 --> 01:36:03,423
Let me out of here!

939
01:36:03,549 --> 01:36:06,509
You'll never get out of here.

940
01:36:07,762 --> 01:36:10,180
Gentlemen, I beg of you!

941
01:36:10,598 --> 01:36:13,516
I don't even know
what you want with me.

942
01:36:13,768 --> 01:36:15,977
I beg you, let me go.

943
01:36:16,187 --> 01:36:19,522
This whole thing must be a mistake!

944
01:36:20,733 --> 01:36:22,192
A mis...

945
01:36:24,153 --> 01:36:25,737
No.

946
01:36:26,322 --> 01:36:29,115
No mistake.
Out of the question.

947
01:36:29,742 --> 01:36:31,993
This is no mistake.

948
01:36:37,708 --> 01:36:39,375
No.

949
01:36:40,085 --> 01:36:41,836
No mistake.

950
01:36:45,966 --> 01:36:47,634
You recognize this?

951
01:36:47,885 --> 01:36:52,597
You bought a balloon just like this
for little Elsie Beckmann.

952
01:36:52,723 --> 01:36:54,432
Just like this one.

953
01:37:00,147 --> 01:37:02,065
No!

954
01:37:03,234 --> 01:37:06,319
Where did you bury
little Marga Perl, you bastard?

955
01:37:11,242 --> 01:37:13,284
But I never...

956
01:37:14,119 --> 01:37:16,412
I never even met her!

957
01:37:19,250 --> 01:37:21,251
You never even met her!

958
01:37:23,754 --> 01:37:25,964
I suppose you never
met her either, huh?

959
01:37:27,842 --> 01:37:29,050
Or her?

960
01:37:31,929 --> 01:37:33,763
You never met her either, huh?

961
01:37:34,765 --> 01:37:36,432
- Stop him!
- Grab him!

962
01:37:36,559 --> 01:37:38,601
- Stop him!
- Don't let him escape!

963
01:37:38,769 --> 01:37:40,520
Watch out! The door!

964
01:37:41,438 --> 01:37:43,940
- Let me out!
- Punch him in the face!

965
01:37:44,108 --> 01:37:46,860
Let go of me!

966
01:38:08,883 --> 01:38:12,635
- You have no right to treat me this way!
- We'll show you we do!

967
01:38:12,845 --> 01:38:15,430
You have no right to hold me here!

968
01:38:15,639 --> 01:38:19,100
Right? There's only one thing
right for a man like you... death!

969
01:38:19,310 --> 01:38:21,352
- Right! Kill him!
- Kill the rabid dog!

970
01:38:21,478 --> 01:38:23,354
- Ice him!
- Let him have it!

971
01:38:23,606 --> 01:38:25,106
Quiet!

972
01:38:25,316 --> 01:38:26,983
Kill him!

973
01:38:36,368 --> 01:38:38,995
You spoke of "right" just now.

974
01:38:40,164 --> 01:38:42,290
We will be your right.

975
01:38:43,667 --> 01:38:47,170
Everyone sitting here
is an expert in the rule of law!

976
01:38:50,132 --> 01:38:52,383
From six weeks in Tegel prison...

977
01:38:52,801 --> 01:38:55,345
to 15 years in Brandenburg.

978
01:38:58,641 --> 01:39:01,809
They'll make sure
you get your rights.

979
01:39:03,020 --> 01:39:04,979
You'll even have defense counsel.

980
01:39:06,273 --> 01:39:08,399
Everything according
to the letter of the law.

981
01:39:08,859 --> 01:39:10,693
Defense counsel?

982
01:39:10,861 --> 01:39:13,821
I need no defense counsel!
Who's gonna prosecute me?

983
01:39:14,114 --> 01:39:15,907
You, perhaps?

984
01:39:18,535 --> 01:39:19,410
Hey, you.

985
01:39:19,662 --> 01:39:23,706
If I were you,
I wouldn't make big speeches.

986
01:39:23,874 --> 01:39:27,669
Your head's at stake here,
in case you hadn't noticed.

987
01:39:28,587 --> 01:39:30,964
And just who are you?

988
01:39:33,050 --> 01:39:38,096
I have the dubious pleasure
of serving as your defense.

989
01:39:39,014 --> 01:39:41,432
Though I'm afraid
it won't do you much good.

990
01:39:43,477 --> 01:39:47,647
Do you all want to kill me?
You want to just wipe me out?

991
01:39:48,232 --> 01:39:51,859
We simply want to put you
out of commission.

992
01:39:52,861 --> 01:39:55,279
And we'll only be sure
of that when you're dead.

993
01:39:55,406 --> 01:39:58,449
But you can't murder me
just like that!

994
01:40:01,161 --> 01:40:04,747
I demand to be handed over
to the police!

995
01:40:08,085 --> 01:40:12,880
I demand to be brought
before a real court of law!

996
01:40:14,133 --> 01:40:15,883
That's a good one!

997
01:40:16,010 --> 01:40:18,553
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?
- Look who's talking!

998
01:40:18,762 --> 01:40:21,723
So you can plead insanity

999
01:40:21,890 --> 01:40:25,018
and spend the rest of your life
being cared for by the state.

1000
01:40:25,227 --> 01:40:28,980
And then you break out of the asylum
or receive a pardon,

1001
01:40:29,356 --> 01:40:32,734
and you're happy as can be,
free to kill with impunity,

1002
01:40:33,277 --> 01:40:36,821
protected by law
on grounds of insanity...

1003
01:40:37,197 --> 01:40:41,159
and you're back to chasing little children!
No, no more of that!

1004
01:40:41,702 --> 01:40:44,287
You must be taken out of action!
You must go!

1005
01:40:45,289 --> 01:40:48,207
But I can't help it!

1006
01:40:53,464 --> 01:40:54,797
I can't...

1007
01:40:55,132 --> 01:41:00,344
I really can't... help it!

1008
01:41:02,765 --> 01:41:04,182
We know that one!

1009
01:41:04,808 --> 01:41:07,143
Before the judge,
we all "can't help it".

1010
01:41:14,026 --> 01:41:15,902
What would you know?

1011
01:41:16,195 --> 01:41:18,196
What are you talking about?

1012
01:41:18,614 --> 01:41:20,948
Who are you anyway?

1013
01:41:21,825 --> 01:41:23,367
Who are you?

1014
01:41:23,786 --> 01:41:25,745
All of you.

1015
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:27,747
Criminals.

1016
01:41:28,874 --> 01:41:31,584
Probably proud of it, too...

1017
01:41:31,919 --> 01:41:34,003
proud you can crack a safe

1018
01:41:34,171 --> 01:41:37,131
or sneak into houses
or cheat at cards.

1019
01:41:37,382 --> 01:41:41,344
All of which it seems to me
you could just as easily give up

1020
01:41:41,720 --> 01:41:44,097
if you had learned something useful,

1021
01:41:44,223 --> 01:41:46,182
or if you had jobs

1022
01:41:46,391 --> 01:41:48,935
or if you weren't such lazy pigs.

1023
01:41:50,395 --> 01:41:52,021
But me?

1024
01:41:52,356 --> 01:41:55,358
Can I do anything about it?

1025
01:41:56,527 --> 01:42:00,530
Don't I have
this cursed thing inside me?

1026
01:42:01,532 --> 01:42:04,700
This fire, this voice, this agony?

1027
01:42:08,497 --> 01:42:10,873
So you mean to say...

1028
01:42:11,750 --> 01:42:13,793
<i>you have to kill?</i>

1029
01:42:18,590 --> 01:42:21,801
I have to roam the streets endlessly,

1030
01:42:22,427 --> 01:42:24,470
always sensing

1031
01:42:24,930 --> 01:42:27,640
that someone's following me.

1032
01:42:27,766 --> 01:42:29,392
It's me!

1033
01:42:29,768 --> 01:42:31,727
I'm shadowing myself!

1034
01:42:33,063 --> 01:42:34,897
Silently...

1035
01:42:35,399 --> 01:42:37,400
but I still hear it!

1036
01:42:37,818 --> 01:42:42,155
Yes, sometimes I feel

1037
01:42:42,281 --> 01:42:44,282
like I'm tracking myself down.

1038
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:48,077
I want to run...
run away from myself!

1039
01:42:48,495 --> 01:42:50,913
But I can't!
I can't escape from myself!

1040
01:42:51,748 --> 01:42:54,917
I must take the path
that it's driving me down

1041
01:42:55,085 --> 01:42:59,839
and run and run
down endless streets!

1042
01:43:00,090 --> 01:43:02,175
I want off!

1043
01:43:03,927 --> 01:43:07,221
And with me run the ghosts

1044
01:43:07,598 --> 01:43:11,017
of the mothers and children.

1045
01:43:11,143 --> 01:43:14,896
They never go away.
They're always there!

1046
01:43:15,105 --> 01:43:16,606
Always!

1047
01:43:16,732 --> 01:43:18,441
Always!

1048
01:43:19,610 --> 01:43:21,194
Except...

1049
01:43:21,778 --> 01:43:23,779
when I'm doing it...

1050
01:43:24,656 --> 01:43:27,033
when I...

1051
01:43:34,208 --> 01:43:36,834
Then I don't remember a thing.

1052
01:43:37,794 --> 01:43:42,215
Then I'm standing before a poster,

1053
01:43:42,341 --> 01:43:44,884
reading what I've done.

1054
01:43:45,135 --> 01:43:47,178
I read and read...

1055
01:43:47,930 --> 01:43:49,847
<i>I did that?</i>

1056
01:43:50,474 --> 01:43:52,600
I don't remember a thing!

1057
01:43:53,727 --> 01:43:55,645
But who will believe me?

1058
01:43:55,812 --> 01:43:58,814
Who knows what it's like inside me?

1059
01:43:58,941 --> 01:44:03,819
How it screams and cries out
inside me when I have to do it!

1060
01:44:04,488 --> 01:44:06,155
Don't want to! Must!

1061
01:44:06,490 --> 01:44:08,783
Don't want to! Must!

1062
01:44:09,493 --> 01:44:12,453
And then a voice cries out,

1063
01:44:12,579 --> 01:44:14,997
and I can't listen anymore!

1064
01:44:15,290 --> 01:44:18,209
Help! I can't!

1065
01:44:18,502 --> 01:44:21,837
I can't!

1066
01:44:27,219 --> 01:44:29,428
The accused has stated

1067
01:44:29,846 --> 01:44:31,931
that he can't help himself.

1068
01:44:32,432 --> 01:44:36,227
<i>In other words,
he must commit murder.</i>

1069
01:44:38,397 --> 01:44:41,190
With that he has pronounced
his own death sentence.

1070
01:44:41,358 --> 01:44:42,692
Right!

1071
01:44:42,859 --> 01:44:45,152
A man who claims

1072
01:44:45,946 --> 01:44:49,240
that he's compelled
to destroy the lives of others...

1073
01:44:49,700 --> 01:44:53,452
such a man must be
extinguished like a bonfire!

1074
01:44:53,620 --> 01:44:55,663
Such a man must be obliterated!

1075
01:44:55,831 --> 01:44:57,373
Wiped out!

1076
01:45:06,550 --> 01:45:08,759
May I address the court?

1077
01:45:09,136 --> 01:45:11,178
Counsel for the defense
has the floor.

1078
01:45:13,598 --> 01:45:17,560
My learned colleague
who just spoke...

1079
01:45:18,895 --> 01:45:21,230
who is, if I'm not mistaken,

1080
01:45:21,481 --> 01:45:24,358
wanted by the police
on three counts of manslaughter...

1081
01:45:24,484 --> 01:45:26,694
That's irrelevant here.

1082
01:45:26,903 --> 01:45:28,404
has claimed

1083
01:45:28,697 --> 01:45:31,824
that the fact that my client
was acting compulsively

1084
01:45:31,950 --> 01:45:33,743
warrants the death sentence.

1085
01:45:33,994 --> 01:45:35,828
That's right!

1086
01:45:36,413 --> 01:45:37,788
He is mistaken,

1087
01:45:38,123 --> 01:45:42,084
because the very nature of compulsion
warrants an acquittal!

1088
01:45:42,252 --> 01:45:43,794
Get outta here, will ya?

1089
01:45:44,713 --> 01:45:45,963
Are you nuts, or plastered?

1090
01:45:46,089 --> 01:45:47,882
It is precisely
the nature of compulsion

1091
01:45:48,008 --> 01:45:51,594
that relieves him
of responsibility for his actions!

1092
01:45:52,012 --> 01:45:55,556
And a man cannot be punished for that

1093
01:45:55,682 --> 01:45:57,141
for which he is not responsible!

1094
01:45:57,267 --> 01:46:01,812
- Ridiculous!
- You mean this monster should go free?

1095
01:46:01,938 --> 01:46:03,606
That he should live?

1096
01:46:03,732 --> 01:46:07,109
I'm saying that this man is sick,

1097
01:46:07,235 --> 01:46:11,197
and you turn a sick man
over to a doctor, not an executioner.

1098
01:46:11,323 --> 01:46:15,451
- Will you guarantee his cure?
- What does the state build asylums for?

1099
01:46:15,619 --> 01:46:19,455
- What if he breaks out?
- Or he's declared cured and released?

1100
01:46:19,581 --> 01:46:21,999
And one fine day
the killing starts all over?

1101
01:46:22,667 --> 01:46:24,460
Another month-long manhunt!

1102
01:46:24,586 --> 01:46:26,545
Once again the insanity clause,
once again the asylum!

1103
01:46:26,671 --> 01:46:30,132
Another breakout or possible release!
And again... "must kill"!

1104
01:46:30,842 --> 01:46:33,719
Is this supposed
to go on indefinitely?

1105
01:46:33,887 --> 01:46:39,225
No one has the right to kill a man

1106
01:46:39,351 --> 01:46:41,352
who cannot be held
responsible for his crimes!

1107
01:46:41,603 --> 01:46:43,187
Not even the state,

1108
01:46:43,480 --> 01:46:46,273
and all of you least of all!

1109
01:46:47,234 --> 01:46:52,113
The state must ensure
that this man is rendered harmless

1110
01:46:52,447 --> 01:46:56,992
so that he ceases to be
a danger to society!

1111
01:47:00,705 --> 01:47:02,998
You never had kids, did ya?

1112
01:47:03,125 --> 01:47:05,209
Then you never lost any either.

1113
01:47:06,837 --> 01:47:09,380
But if you wanna know what it's like

1114
01:47:09,506 --> 01:47:12,508
when a little child is taken from you,

1115
01:47:12,634 --> 01:47:15,928
just ask the parents
whose kids he took away!

1116
01:47:16,680 --> 01:47:21,725
Ask 'em about the days and nights
not knowing what had happened,

1117
01:47:22,477 --> 01:47:25,146
and later,
when they finally found out...

1118
01:47:26,815 --> 01:47:29,275
Why don't you ask the mothers?

1119
01:47:29,443 --> 01:47:31,735
You should ask the mothers!

1120
01:47:32,028 --> 01:47:34,071
Think you'd get mercy
from any of them

1121
01:47:34,197 --> 01:47:36,365
for murdering their kids?

1122
01:47:36,533 --> 01:47:38,242
- The woman's right!
- Absolutely!

1123
01:47:38,368 --> 01:47:40,369
No mercy for the killer!

1124
01:47:40,495 --> 01:47:42,204
- Let him have it!
- Slaughter the bastard!

1125
01:47:42,330 --> 01:47:45,207
- Kill the monster!
- Kill him!

1126
01:47:45,375 --> 01:47:47,376
- Put the animal to death!
- Rub him out!

1127
01:47:47,544 --> 01:47:49,420
- Kill him!
- Waste him!

1128
01:47:49,546 --> 01:47:53,382
- Get rid of him!
- Annihilate the monster!

1129
01:47:54,551 --> 01:47:57,887
I will not let you shout me down!

1130
01:48:01,475 --> 01:48:08,063
I will not allow a murder
to be committed in my presence.

1131
01:48:08,398 --> 01:48:11,317
I demand that this human being...

1132
01:48:11,568 --> 01:48:12,860
That's not a human being!

1133
01:48:12,986 --> 01:48:16,280
that this human being be afforded
the same protection under the law

1134
01:48:16,531 --> 01:48:18,199
rendered the common criminal!

1135
01:48:18,408 --> 01:48:19,909
Not a chance!

1136
01:48:20,076 --> 01:48:23,579
I demand that he be
handed over to the police!

1137
01:48:23,705 --> 01:48:26,916
The police!
Of all the dumb...

1138
01:48:53,944 --> 01:48:55,778
In the name of the law...

1139
01:49:19,469 --> 01:49:21,136
In the name of the people...

1140
01:49:21,304 --> 01:49:25,891
This will not bring
our children back.

1141
01:49:30,939 --> 01:49:32,898
One has to...

1142
01:49:33,567 --> 01:49:35,401
keep closer watch...

1143
01:49:36,820 --> 01:49:39,488
over the children!

1144
01:49:41,491 --> 01:49:42,992
<i>All of you!</i>
